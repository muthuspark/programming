  Conclusion
  <a class="anchor" href="#conclusion">#</a>
</h4>
<p>DIC India Limited shows a strong financial position in 2024, with low debt, increased working capital, and a reasonable asset turnover. However, the increase in inventory, the decrease in cash and cash equivalents, and the significant contingent liabilities warrant further investigation. The company&rsquo;s proactive reduction of debt is a positive sign, but the reasons behind the shifts in asset composition and the potential impact of the contingent liabilities need to be carefully considered. The sharp increase in current tax liabilities also requires explanation.</p>

<li><strong>ROE:</strong>  Measures the return generated on shareholders&rsquo; equity.   The significant improvement in 2024 indicates a return to profitability.</li>
<li><strong>ROA:</strong>  Measures how efficiently assets are used to generate profit. The improvement from 2023 to 2024 shows better asset utilization, reflecting the turn to profitability.</li>
<li><strong>ROIC:</strong> Measures the return on the total capital invested (both equity and debt). Here, I&rsquo;m considering, &ldquo;Capital Employed&rdquo; from the report. A positive ROIC in 2024 is an improvement after two years of very low returns.</li>
<li><strong>Margins:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Gross Profit Margin:</strong> Calculated from (Revenue - Cost of Materials Consumed - Changes in inventories + Purchase of stock in trade) / Revenue. Remains relatively stable, showing effective Cost of Sales.</li>
<li><strong>Operating Profit Margin:</strong>  Calculated as (Revenue - Operating Expenses) / Revenue, where Operating Expenses include Cost of Materials Consumed, Purchases of stock-in-trade, Change in Inventory, Employee benefit, Depreciation, Other expenses. Improvement in 2024 is likely.</li>
<li><strong>Net Profit Margin:</strong>  Net income divided by revenue. The shift from a negative margin in 2023 to a positive margin in 2024 is the most critical observation.</li>
