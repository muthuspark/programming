<p>It&rsquo;s difficult to provide precise industry benchmarks without knowing the specific sub-sector of the Information and Communication Technology and Fintech industries that DiGiSPICE operates in. However, general comparisons can be made:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Current Ratio:</strong> A healthy current ratio is generally considered to be between 1.5 and 2.0 for most industries. DiGiSPICE&rsquo;s current ratio is improving but still below the average.</li>
<li><strong>Debt-to-Equity Ratio:</strong> A &ldquo;good&rdquo; debt-to-equity ratio varies widely by industry. Tech companies often have lower debt ratios. DiGiSPICE, being virtually debt-free (excluding lease liabilities), is in a strong position in this regard.</li>
<li><strong>Return on Equity:</strong> The ROE increase is significant. ROE of Profitable and growing tech companies is above 15%.</li>
<li><strong>NPA Ratio:</strong> is not applicable to the non-financial company.</li>
<li><strong>Capital Adequacy Ratio:</strong> This ratio is not applicable to non-financial companies.</li>
<li><strong>Revenue from operations:</strong> Indicates negative growth in FY24.</li>

<p><strong>Key Observations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>OCF:</strong> A significant portion of the positive OCF in FY24 is due to a large write-back of unclaimed balances and recovery of bad debts, and reversal of provisions, suggesting a potential one-time boost. Improvement in OCF is also notable due to a significant decrease in trade payables.</li>
<li><strong>ICF:</strong> Positive due to interest income and proceed from sale of assets. The increase is driven by large investments and a shift in strategy.</li>
<li><strong>FCF:</strong> The Group moved funds from operating and investment activities.</li>
