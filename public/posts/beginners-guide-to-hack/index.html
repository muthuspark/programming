<p>After writing your script, thoroughly test it:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Run the script:</strong> Execute your script and observe its output.  Does it produce the expected results?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Check for errors:</strong>  Examine any error messages carefully.  Python&rsquo;s error messages often provide helpful clues about the problem&rsquo;s location and nature.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Use print statements:</strong> Insert <code>print()</code> statements at various points in your code to display intermediate values and track the program&rsquo;s execution flow.  This helps pinpoint where problems occur.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Iterative refinement:</strong>  Based on your testing, refine your code to correct errors and improve its functionality.  Debugging is an iterative process—expect to make adjustments and retest.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 class="heading" id="deploying-your-project">
  Deploying Your Project
  <a class="anchor" href="#deploying-your-project">#</a>
</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Deployment&rdquo; in this simple context means making your script easily runnable.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Create a script file:</strong> Save your code in a file (e.g., <code>rename_files.py</code>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Make it executable (if needed):</strong> On Linux/macOS, use <code>chmod +x rename_files.py</code> to make it executable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Document your script:</strong> Add comments to your code explaining its purpose and functionality.  This makes it easier for you (and others) to understand it later.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Consider error handling:</strong> Add <code>try...except</code> blocks to handle potential errors (e.g., file not found) gracefully. This prevents your script from crashing unexpectedly.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>For more complex projects, deployment might involve creating installers, setting up cron jobs for automation, or deploying to a server.  For this simple example, ensuring the script runs correctly from the command line (<code>python rename_files.py</code>) suffices.  This marks the completion of your first hacking project. Remember to always test your scripts thoroughly in a safe environment before applying them to critical systems.</p>
