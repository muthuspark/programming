</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Severity:</strong> High. Scaling production to 4 million units by FY 2030-31, nearly doubling current output, poses significant strategic challenges.</li>
<li><strong>Likelihood:</strong> High. The aggressive growth target (doubling output in 7-8 years, versus 40 years for the first 2 million) increases the probability of encountering execution challenges.</li>
<li><strong>Trend:</strong> Increasing. The shift in operational scale and complexity presents a growing strategic risk.</li>
<li><strong>Mitigation Strategies:</strong> A dedicated organization for FY 2030-31 goals has been established. Digitalization is leveraged for data-driven decision-making.</li>
<li><strong>Control Effectiveness:</strong> Partially effective. Early stages, measures in place, but success dependent on rapid adaptation and scaling.</li>

<li><strong>Scenario: Softening of Interest Rates, Inflation, and Fuel Prices:</strong> A positive impact on PV industry prospects is projected. This is directly related to the affordability factor influencing consumer purchasing power.</li>
<li><strong>Scenario: Geopolitical Situation Normalization:</strong> A positive effect on the PV industry is expected, reducing supply chain risks and promoting economic stability.</li>
<li><strong>Scenario: Successful Implementation of Growth Strategy:</strong> The Company anticipates achieving significant operational scale (4 million units per year by FY 2030-31) and increasing operational complexities, necessitating effective management of resources and stakeholder partnerships. The assumptions are that the strategy will be accepted.</li>
<li><strong>Assumption: Powertrain Mix by FY 2030-31:</strong> The projected mix (15% BEVs, 25% Hybrids, 60% CNG/Biofuels/ICE) assumes continued consumer preference for multiple powertrain technologies and government policies that support all alternative fuel technologies.</li>
<li><strong>Sensitivity:</strong> Deviation in interest rates, inflation, commodity prices, fuel prices or increased regulation could adversely affect the projected outcomes.</li>
<li><strong>Sensitivity</strong>: Changes in consumer preferences, away from the projected fuel type distribution, could pose a risk.</li>
