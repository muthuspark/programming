  Analysis of Accounting Quality and Regulatory Risk Assessment
  <a class="anchor" href="#analysis-of-accounting-quality-and-regulatory-risk-assessment">#</a>
</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Accounting Quality:</strong> The unmodified audit opinion suggests high accounting quality. However, the qualification related to accounting records indicates an area for improvement in physical maintenance of books. The Company&rsquo;s use of a recognized framework (Ind AS) and detailed accounting policies indicate a commitment to transparent and reliable financial reporting.</li>
<li><strong>Regulatory Risk Assessment:</strong> While the Company is generally compliant, the noted non-compliances related to related party transactions and risk management committee meetings, as well as servers located outside India and delay in taking timely actions highlight a moderate regulatory risk. The proactive resolution with SEBI and obtaining post-facto shareholder approval demonstrates the Company&rsquo;s willingness to address compliance issues. However, the recurrence of such issues suggests a need for enhanced internal processes.</li>
