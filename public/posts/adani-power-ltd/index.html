<p>This analysis looks into Adani Power Limited&rsquo;s (APL) Integrated Annual Report for FY2023-24, examining its financial performance, business segments, risk profile, and ESG initiatives.</p>
<p><strong>I. Financial Performance:</strong></p>
<p>APL reported a strong financial performance in FY2023-24, significantly exceeding the previous year&rsquo;s figures.  Key highlights include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Revenue:</strong>  Total revenue surged to ₹60,281 crore (USD ~10 billion), a remarkable 40% increase compared to ₹43,041 crore in FY2022-23.  This growth is attributed to higher sales volumes, improved Plant Load Factor (PLF), capacity expansion (Godda plant commissioning), and significant one-time revenue recognition from regulatory recoveries (₹9,322 crore).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>EBITDA:</strong> EBITDA experienced a substantial 96% jump to ₹28,111 crore, from ₹14,312 crore in FY2022-23, driven by higher revenue and lower imported fuel prices, coupled with improved fuel cost recovery.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>PAT:</strong>  Profit After Tax (PAT) increased by 94% to ₹20,829 crore compared to ₹10,727 crore in FY2022-23, reflecting the strong operational and financial performance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Debt Reduction:</strong>  APL significantly deleveraged its balance sheet, reducing its net external debt-to-equity ratio from 1.09x to 0.62x.  This was achieved through robust cash flows from operations and regulatory recoveries, enabling substantial debt prepayment. The Net Debt per MW also improved significantly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Profitability Metrics:</strong>  Return on Equity (ROE) reached an impressive 48% in FY2023-24, up from 36% in FY2022-23.  The PAT margin also improved considerably.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key Observations:</strong>  While the impressive growth in FY2023-24 is noteworthy, a significant portion is due to one-time regulatory recoveries.  Analyzing the underlying operational performance and excluding these one-time items provides a more accurate assessment of the core business strength.</p>
<p><strong>II. Business Segments:</strong></p>
<p>Adani Power&rsquo;s primary business is thermal power generation, with a significant focus on coal-based plants.  The report highlights the following aspects:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Large Capacity:</strong> APL operates 15,250 MW of operational capacity and 1,600 MW under construction.  It holds 6.3% of India&rsquo;s coal + lignite-based generation capacity.</li>
<li><strong>Geographic Diversification:</strong>  The Company owns and operates power plants across seven states (Gujarat, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Karnataka, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Jharkhand), mitigating regional risk.</li>
<li><strong>Technology:</strong>  A large share of its capacity utilizes supercritical/ultra-supercritical technologies (72%), which are more efficient and less emission-intensive compared to older technologies.</li>
<li><strong>Fuel Security:</strong>  A significant portion (79%) of domestic fuel requirements are secured via long-term / medium-term contracts.  The Company is also de-risking fuel supply by increasing reliance on coal from commercial mines.</li>
<li><strong>International Presence:</strong> The 1,600 MW Godda plant (commissioned in FY2023-24), marks APL’s first transnational power project, supplying electricity to Bangladesh. This is a significant strategic move to tap international markets.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>III. Risks:</strong></p>
<p>The annual report identifies various risks faced by APL.  These include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Regulatory Risks:</strong>  Changes in policies related to coal, environmental regulations, and electricity tariffs can impact profitability and operations.  The successful navigation of many regulatory disputes in FY2023-24 is highlighted, but future disputes remain a risk.</li>
<li><strong>Commodity Price Risk:</strong> Fluctuations in international and domestic coal prices represent a major risk, impacting production costs and profitability.  The company has implemented measures to mitigate this risk through long-term contracts and diversification of coal sources, but price volatility persists.</li>
<li><strong>Reputational Risks:</strong> The report extensively addresses the short-seller attack in 2023, emphasizing its impact on reputation and financial markets. The Company&rsquo;s management stresses its commitment to governance and transparency to mitigate such risks.</li>
<li><strong>Operational Risks:</strong>  Unplanned outages, equipment failures, and supply chain disruptions can severely affect operations.  APL emphasizes its investments in advanced technologies and robust O&amp;M processes to improve reliability and efficiency.</li>
<li><strong>Climate Change Risks:</strong>  Transitional (policy changes towards renewable energy) and physical (extreme weather events) climate change risks are highlighted, especially concerning the long-term viability of thermal power.  However, the report also presents APL&rsquo;s initiatives to mitigate these risks and integrate renewable energy into the portfolio.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>IV. ESG Initiatives:</strong></p>
<p>Adani Power presents an overview of its ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) performance and initiatives.  Key highlights are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Environmental Focus:</strong>  The report emphasizes the Company&rsquo;s commitment to decarbonization and reducing its environmental footprint.  Measures include the adoption of supercritical/ultra-supercritical technologies, flue gas desulfurization (FGD), and exploration of alternative fuels like green ammonia and biomass co-firing.</li>
<li><strong>Water Management:</strong>  APL reports initiatives aimed at reducing water intensity and promoting responsible water resource management, including closed-loop cooling systems and seawater utilization.</li>
<li><strong>Waste Management:</strong>  Fly ash utilization is highlighted, along with initiatives to reduce single-use plastics.</li>
<li><strong>Social Initiatives (CSR):</strong>  Adani Foundation&rsquo;s programs focusing on education, health, and community development are highlighted, emphasizing its positive social impact.  A large number of people have benefitted from these initiatives.</li>
<li><strong>Governance:</strong>  The report emphasizes the Company&rsquo;s strong commitment to corporate governance best practices, board diversity, transparency, and risk management.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key Observations:</strong> APL’s ESG reporting is extensive, aligning with global standards.  However, the independence and reliability of some of the presented data, especially the social impact of CSR projects and certain environmental indicators, could be strengthened through greater external assurance.</p>
<p><strong>V. Overall Assessment:</strong></p>
<p>Adani Power&rsquo;s Integrated Annual Report for FY2023-24 showcases strong financial performance, driven largely by operational improvements and one-time factors.  The Company demonstrates a diversified geographic presence and emphasizes technological advancements, though it heavily relies on coal for power generation.  The report openly addresses significant reputational risks and highlights substantial efforts toward ESG improvements. However, it&rsquo;s essential to critically examine the extent to which these efforts translate into long-term sustainable value creation and assess data reliability through greater independent verification.  The significant reliance on thermal power and associated environmental risks also necessitate a thorough evaluation of the Company&rsquo;s long-term sustainability strategy within the broader context of the global energy transition.  The financial performance&rsquo;s dependence on regulatory recoveries warrants closer scrutiny of the business&rsquo; underlying operational health.</p>

</ul>
<p>Note that these figures are from the standalone financial statements.  The consolidated financial statements will include the equity of subsidiary companies, resulting in different totals.  The consolidated shareholders&rsquo; equity is ₹43,145.03 crore.  Retained earnings and share capital are not broken down separately within the consolidated statements.</p>

</h3>
<p>The Adani Power Limited standalone financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2024, report the following (in ₹ crore):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Revenue from Operations:</strong> ₹39,204.57</li>
<li><strong>Cost of Revenue (Fuel Cost + Purchase of Stock-in-trade/Power + Transmission Charges):</strong> ₹22,426.06 + ₹214.51 + ₹399.75 = ₹23,040.32 crore</li>
<li><strong>Gross Profit (Revenue - Cost of Revenue):</strong> ₹39,204.57 - ₹23,040.32 = ₹16,164.25 crore</li>
<li><strong>Operating Expenses (Employee Benefits Expenses + Depreciation &amp; Amortization Expense + Other Expenses):</strong> ₹554.19 + ₹3,175.72 + ₹1,789.70 = ₹5,519.61 crore</li>
<li><strong>Operating Income (Gross Profit - Operating Expenses):</strong> ₹16,164.25 - ₹5,519.61 = ₹10,644.64 crore</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Note:</strong>  These figures are calculated based on the line items presented in the standalone Statement of Profit and Loss. The Company&rsquo;s presentation does not explicitly define &ldquo;Cost of Revenue&rdquo; as a single line item;  therefore,  we&rsquo;ve had to calculate it by summing the relevant expenses.  The consolidated figures will differ due to the inclusion of subsidiary company data and are not directly available in a comparable format in the report.</p>
<h3 class="heading" id="bottom-line-metrics">
  Bottom Line Metrics
  <a class="anchor" href="#bottom-line-metrics">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Based on Adani Power Limited&rsquo;s standalone financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2024:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Net Income (Profit for the year):</strong> ₹18,749.24 crore</li>
<li><strong>EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization):  This needs to be calculated as the report doesn&rsquo;t present it directly.</strong>  It would be calculated as: Profit Before Tax + Depreciation &amp; Amortization + Finance Costs = ₹18,370.59 + ₹3,175.72 + ₹2,465.90 = ₹24,012.21 crore.  However, this figure needs careful consideration due to the inclusion of one-time regulatory items in the Profit Before Tax.  A more reliable EBITDA figure would require adjusting for these.</li>
<li><strong>Basic EPS (Earnings Per Share):</strong> ₹46.24</li>
<li><strong>Diluted EPS (Earnings Per Share):</strong> ₹46.24</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Note:</strong> The EBITDA figure provided above is a calculation based on the information available.  The inclusion of one-time items in the Profit Before Tax makes the standard EBITDA calculation potentially misleading. A  more accurate reflection of underlying operating performance would necessitate adjusting for these. The report provides consolidated net income and total detailed income figures but does not directly state consolidated EBITDA, basic EPS, or diluted EPS.  These values should be viewed cautiously as one-time adjustments and other significant items impact their accuracy as presented.</p>

</h3>
<p>Based on Adani Power Limited&rsquo;s standalone Statement of Cash Flows for the year ended March 31, 2024 (in ₹ crore):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities:</strong> ₹14,840.73 crore</li>
<li><strong>Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities:</strong> ₹1,086.35 crore</li>
<li><strong>Net Cash Flow from Financing Activities:</strong> ₹(15,560.55) crore</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Note:</strong> These figures are from the standalone statement. The consolidated Statement of Cash Flows will present different values due to the inclusion of subsidiary company data.  The consolidated statement does not provide the same line-item breakdown; therefore a direct comparison is not possible without significant recalculation.</p>
<h3 class="heading" id="cash-flow-metrics">
  Cash Flow Metrics
  <a class="anchor" href="#cash-flow-metrics">#</a>
</h3>
<p>The Adani Power Limited standalone financial statements don&rsquo;t directly provide a free cash flow figure.  Free cash flow is typically calculated as operating cash flow less capital expenditures.  Using the figures from the standalone Statement of Cash Flows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Operating Cash Flow:</strong> ₹14,840.73 crore</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Capital Expenditure (CAPEX):</strong> This is not explicitly stated as a single line item in the standalone statement.  It&rsquo;s represented by various payments towards Property, Plant, and Equipment; therefore, extracting a precise CAPEX number requires detailed analysis of the cash flow statement, possibly supplemented by information from the notes to the accounts.  A precise figure cannot be confidently extracted from this report.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dividends Paid:</strong> The report explicitly states that <em>no dividend</em> was paid to equity shareholders during the fiscal year.  However, dividend was paid to preference shareholders. The amount is not specified in the summary.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To determine a precise free cash flow number for the standalone statements, a more detailed breakdown of capital expenditures from the Statement of Cash Flows is needed.  The consolidated statements would show different values due to the inclusion of subsidiaries.  Therefore, deriving a free cash flow number from the information provided requires considerable further analysis.</p>

</h3>
<p>Calculating profitability ratios requires using figures from the standalone financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2024, because consolidated figures aren&rsquo;t presented in a directly comparable way in the report.  Furthermore,  remember that the &ldquo;Cost of Revenue&rdquo; is a calculation (as explained in a previous response), and the inclusion of one-time regulatory gains impacts the profitability ratios, especially the net profit margin and return on equity.</p>
<p>Using the standalone figures (in ₹ crore):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Revenue:</strong> ₹39,204.57 crore</li>
<li><strong>Cost of Revenue (calculated):</strong> ₹23,040.32 crore</li>
<li><strong>Gross Profit (Revenue - Cost of Revenue):</strong> ₹16,164.25 crore</li>
<li><strong>Operating Income:</strong> ₹10,644.64 crore  (This calculation is also dependent upon prior responses and may be affected by one-time items.)</li>
<li><strong>Net Income:</strong> ₹18,749.24 crore</li>
<li><strong>Shareholders&rsquo; Equity:</strong> ₹39,448.05 crore</li>
<li><strong>Total Assets:</strong> ₹75,171.95 crore</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the profitability ratios, keeping in mind the caveats above:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Gross Margin:</strong> (Gross Profit / Revenue) * 100 = (₹16,164.25 crore / ₹39,204.57 crore) * 100 = <strong>41.18%</strong></li>
<li><strong>Operating Margin:</strong> (Operating Income / Revenue) * 100 = (₹10,644.64 crore / ₹39,204.57 crore) * 100 = <strong>27.17%</strong></li>
<li><strong>Net Profit Margin:</strong> (Net Income / Revenue) * 100 = (₹18,749.24 crore / ₹39,204.57 crore) * 100 = <strong>47.85%</strong></li>
<li><strong>Return on Equity (ROE):</strong> (Net Income / Shareholders&rsquo; Equity) * 100 = (₹18,749.24 crore / ₹39,448.05 crore) * 100 = <strong>47.53%</strong></li>
<li><strong>Return on Assets (ROA):</strong> (Net Income / Total Assets) * 100 = (₹18,749.24 crore / ₹75,171.95 crore) * 100 = <strong>24.95%</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Disclaimer:</strong>  The net profit margin and ROE are significantly affected by the substantial one-time gains.  A more accurate representation of the underlying profitability would necessitate adjusting for those one-time items. The figures presented here reflect the raw numbers from the standalone financial statements,  which include one-time significant items and may not accurately reflect the long-term profitability or underlying operational efficiency of Adani Power Limited.</p>

  Liquidity Ratios
  <a class="anchor" href="#liquidity-ratios">#</a>
</h3>
<p>To calculate these ratios, we&rsquo;ll use the figures from Adani Power Limited&rsquo;s standalone financial statements as of March 31, 2024 (in ₹ crore):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Current Assets:</strong> ₹20,650.82 crore</li>
<li><strong>Current Liabilities:</strong> ₹12,416.33 crore</li>
<li><strong>Cash and Cash Equivalents:</strong> ₹560.29 crore</li>
<li><strong>Accounts Receivable:</strong> ₹6,695.19 crore</li>
<li><strong>Inventories:</strong> ₹3,474.89 crore</li>
</ul>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the calculation of the liquidity ratios:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Current Ratio:</strong> Current Assets / Current Liabilities = ₹20,650.82 crore / ₹12,416.33 crore = <strong>1.66</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Quick Ratio (Acid-Test Ratio):</strong> (Current Assets - Inventories) / Current Liabilities = (₹20,650.82 crore - ₹3,474.89 crore) / ₹12,416.33 crore = <strong>1.38</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cash Ratio:</strong> (Cash and Cash Equivalents) / Current Liabilities = ₹560.29 crore / ₹12,416.33 crore = <strong>0.045</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Note:</strong>  These ratios are based on the standalone financial statements. Consolidated figures would differ due to the inclusion of subsidiaries.  Also, the interpretation of these ratios requires consideration of the industry context and the specific circumstances of Adani Power Limited&rsquo;s business model.  A current ratio of 1.66 suggests a reasonable ability to meet short-term obligations, while the quick ratio and cash ratio indicate a lower capacity to pay off liabilities immediately using only the most liquid assets.  A more thorough analysis would require a comparison to industry benchmarks and an understanding of the Company’s working capital management practices.</p>

  Efficiency Ratios
  <a class="anchor" href="#efficiency-ratios">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Calculating efficiency ratios requires using data from Adani Power Limited&rsquo;s standalone financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2024 (in ₹ crore).  Keep in mind that using standalone data excludes the performance of subsidiaries.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Net Sales (Revenue):</strong> ₹39,204.57 crore</li>
<li><strong>Average Total Assets:</strong> (Beginning Total Assets + Ending Total Assets) / 2  This requires the beginning total assets, which aren&rsquo;t explicitly provided in this report.  Therefore, a precise asset turnover cannot be calculated.</li>
<li><strong>Average Inventory:</strong> (Beginning Inventory + Ending Inventory) / 2 = (This also requires the beginning inventory value, which is not available in the report) Therefore, a precise inventory turnover ratio cannot be calculated.</li>
<li><strong>Average Accounts Receivable:</strong> (Beginning Accounts Receivable + Ending Accounts Receivable) / 2 = (This also requires the beginning accounts receivable value, which is not explicitly given.) Therefore, a precise receivables turnover ratio cannot be calculated.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong>  Precise calculations of asset turnover, inventory turnover, and receivables turnover are impossible with the data provided in this annual report.  The report lacks the necessary beginning-of-year figures for these key metrics.  To calculate these ratios accurately, the beginning-of-year values for total assets, inventory, and accounts receivable are needed.</p>

  Leverage Ratios
  <a class="anchor" href="#leverage-ratios">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Calculating use ratios requires data from Adani Power Limited&rsquo;s standalone financial statements as of March 31, 2024 (in ₹ crore):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Total Debt:</strong>  This needs to be calculated.  It would include current and non-current borrowings, current and non-current lease liabilities, and other current and non-current financial liabilities.  Therefore, a precise figure can&rsquo;t be stated without doing the calculation.</li>
<li><strong>Shareholders&rsquo; Equity:</strong> ₹39,448.05 crore</li>
<li><strong>Total Assets:</strong> ₹75,171.95 crore</li>
<li><strong>EBIT (Earnings Before Interest and Taxes):</strong>  This needs calculation. It is usually calculated as Operating Income + Finance Costs = ₹10,644.64 crore (as calculated earlier, with caveats) + ₹2,465.90 crore = ₹13,110.54 crore. However, this is also potentially affected by one-time regulatory gains impacting its reliability as an indicator of operational performance.</li>
<li><strong>Interest Expense:</strong> ₹2,465.90 crore</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the use ratios, with important caveats:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Debt-to-Equity Ratio:</strong> Total Debt / Shareholders&rsquo; Equity = (This calculation requires the total debt figure, which is not directly available in the summary. A precise ratio cannot be calculated without this data)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Debt-to-Assets Ratio:</strong> Total Debt / Total Assets = (This calculation requires the total debt figure, which is not directly available in the summary. A precise ratio cannot be calculated without this data)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Interest Coverage Ratio:</strong> EBIT / Interest Expense = ₹13,110.54 crore / ₹2,465.90 crore = <strong>5.31</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Considerations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Missing Data:</strong>  The standalone statement does not directly give a single figure for &ldquo;Total Debt,&rdquo; making precise calculations of the debt-to-equity and debt-to-assets ratios impossible. To perform these calculations, we would need to sum all liability accounts representing debt (borrowings, lease obligations, other financial liabilities) from both the current and non-current sections of the balance sheet.</li>
<li><strong>EBIT Reliability:</strong> The EBIT figure used in the interest coverage ratio calculation is subject to the same caveats mentioned previously, with one-time gains potentially inflating the ratio and not reflecting the true long-term earnings of the core business.</li>
<li><strong>Consolidated vs. Standalone:</strong> The standalone ratios will differ from consolidated ratios, which would include debt and equity information from subsidiary companies.</li>
</ul>
<p>To calculate the debt ratios accurately, you must calculate the total debt.  The interest coverage ratio, while calculable, should be interpreted cautiously due to the potential impact of one-time gains on EBIT.</p>

<p>The Adani Power Limited annual report provides some data points needed for these calculations, but not all of them.  Therefore, some of these ratios can only be partially or approximately calculated.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Market Capitalization:</strong>  The report provides the market capitalization at various points but doesn&rsquo;t give a single year-end figure.  To obtain an accurate market cap, you need the closing share price on March 31, 2024 and the total number of outstanding shares. This data isn&rsquo;t explicitly presented in a consolidated manner in the report, although information is available to allow calculation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Price-to-Earnings Ratio (PE Ratio):</strong> This requires the market capitalization (as above) and the earnings per share (EPS).  The report provides the EPS (₹46.24 for standalone), but, as stated before, the accuracy of this number is questionable due to one-time gains. A precise PE ratio cannot be determined from the available information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Price-to-Book Ratio (PB Ratio):</strong> This requires the market capitalization (as above) and the book value per share.  The book value per share needs to be calculated from the shareholders’ equity and total number of outstanding shares.  This data isn&rsquo;t provided in a directly usable form in the report. A precise PB ratio cannot be calculated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dividend Yield:</strong> This requires the annual dividend per share and the share price. The report does not provide the dividend per share paid during this financial year to the equity shareholders, only that no such dividend was paid. Therefore, the dividend yield cannot be calculated.  The dividend paid to the preference shareholders is also not specified.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dividend Payout Ratio:</strong> This requires the dividends paid to equity shareholders and the net income attributable to equity shareholders.  As no dividend was paid to the equity shareholders, the dividend payout ratio is <strong>0%</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In summary:  Only the dividend payout ratio can be definitively stated (0%).  The other ratios (market cap, PE, PB, and dividend yield) require additional information not directly available in the provided annual report summary.  To calculate these accurately, you will need to obtain the year-end share price and the precise number of outstanding shares.</p>

<p><strong>V. Sustainability Goals:</strong></p>
<p>The  report  outlines  many  sustainability goals,  many  of  which  are  aligned  with  the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). These include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Climate Change Mitigation:</strong>  Reducing greenhouse gas emissions intensity, exploring alternative fuels, and increasing renewable energy capacity.</li>
<li><strong>Environmental Stewardship:</strong>  Responsible water  management, waste reduction and  recycling, biodiversity conservation.</li>
<li><strong>Social Inclusion:</strong>  Empowering marginalized communities through CSR programs, promoting employee well-being, and creating job opportunities.</li>
<li><strong>Good Corporate Governance:</strong>  Maintaining high ethical standards, transparency, and robust risk management practices.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key Observations:</strong> Adani Power demonstrates a commitment to ESG issues.  However,  the  effectiveness  of  its  initiatives and  the  overall  impact  of  its  sustainability strategy requires further independent scrutiny and verifiable evidence.  The extent to which the Company&rsquo;s  reliance  on  coal  power  aligns  with  its  longterm  sustainability  goals  should  also  be  carefully considered, given the global energy transition towards renewable energy sources.</p>

</h3>
<p>The Adani Power Limited annual report highlights many significant events during FY2023-24:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Commissioning of Godda Power Plant:</strong>  The successful commissioning of the 1,600 MW Godda Ultra-supercritical thermal power plant, a transnational project supplying power to Bangladesh, is a major milestone.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Regulatory Victories:</strong>  The  Company  secured  favorable  rulings  from  the  Supreme  Court  on  many  longstanding regulatory appeals, resolving disputes and leading to significant revenue recoveries.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Credit Rating Upgrades:</strong>  Adani Power received credit rating upgrades from CRISIL and India Ratings, reflecting improved financial strength and operational performance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Debt Consolidation and Reduction:</strong>  The Company successfully consolidated its term loan facilities and significantly reduced its debt levels, improving financial flexibility.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Successful Turnaround of Mahan Energen:</strong>  The  turnaround  of  the  Mahan  Energen  power  plant,  acquired  in  an  earlier  year,  demonstrates  the  Company&rsquo;s asset management capabilities and improved financial performance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Initiation of Green Ammonia Co-firing Project:</strong>  The  launch  of  a  pilot  green  ammonia  combustion project at its Mundra plant signifies the Company’s commitment towards exploring and implementing sustainable solutions for reducing its carbon footprint.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Acquisition Plans:</strong>  The  approval  of  acquisition plans for Coastal Energen Private Limited and Lanco  Amarkantak  Power  Limited  through  the  Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) process signals the Company&rsquo;s  continued  expansion  strategy  and  capacity building.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>New Long-Term PPA:</strong>  Mahan Energen Limited secured a  new  20-year  long-term  PPA  with  Reliance Industries Limited, further enhancing revenue stability.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Short Seller Report:</strong> The report extensively addresses the impact of a short-seller report on the Company’s reputation and its efforts to mitigate negative consequences.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These events underscore a year of substantial progress for Adani Power, marked by both operational improvements and strategic initiatives aimed at enhancing its long-term growth and sustainability.  However,  the  impact  of  the  shortseller  report  and  the  reliance  on  regulatory  recoveries  for  a  substantial  portion  of  the  revenue  growth warrants careful consideration when assessing the overall significance of the year&rsquo;s achievements.</p>

<p><strong>Auditor&rsquo;s Opinion:</strong></p>
<p>The independent auditor, S R B C &amp; Co LLP, issued a <em>qualified</em> opinion on both the standalone and consolidated financial statements of Adani Power Limited for the year ended March 31, 2024.  The qualification relates to uncertainties surrounding the potential effects of pending adjudications/investigations by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) regarding allegations made in a short-seller report in 2023.  The auditor was unable to assess the potential impact of these investigations on the financial statements.  In all other material aspects, the auditor found the financial statements to present a true and fair view.</p>
<p><strong>Key Accounting Policies:</strong></p>
<p>Several key accounting policies are detailed in the notes to the standalone and consolidated financial statements.  Key highlights include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Basis of Preparation:</strong> The financial statements are prepared in accordance with Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) and the Companies Act, 2013.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Property, Plant, and Equipment (PP&amp;E):</strong> PP&amp;E is measured at historical cost, less accumulated depreciation and impairment. Borrowing costs are capitalized for qualifying assets.  Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives, which vary by asset category.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Financial Instruments:</strong>  Financial assets and liabilities are initially measured at fair value, except for trade receivables (not having significant financing components) which are measured at amortised cost. Subsequent measurement depends on the classification of the financial instrument (amortized cost, fair value through other detailed income (FVOCI), fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL)).  Impairment is assessed using the expected credit loss (ECL) model.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Government Grants:</strong> Government grants are recognized when there is reasonable assurance of receipt and compliance with conditions.  Grants related to assets are recognized over the useful life of the asset, while grants related to income are recognized in the period the related cost is incurred.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Leases:</strong>  The Group applies the IFRS 16 &lsquo;Leases&rsquo; standard, recognizing right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for all leases except for short-term leases and leases of low-value assets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Revenue Recognition:</strong>  Revenue from contracts with customers is recognized when control of goods or services is transferred to the customer. Specific criteria are applied depending on the nature of the contract (power supply, sale of goods, etc).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Taxes:</strong>  Income tax expense includes current tax and deferred tax. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Borrowing Costs:</strong> Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction, or production of qualifying assets are capitalized; all other borrowing costs are expensed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Employee Benefits:</strong>  The Group accounts for both defined contribution plans (provident fund) and defined benefit plans (gratuity).  Actuarial valuations are used to determine the liability for defined benefit plans.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Impairment of Assets:</strong> Impairment testing is performed annually for goodwill and when there is an indication that assets may be impaired.  The recoverable amount is determined as the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Foreign Currency:</strong> Transactions in foreign currencies are translated using the exchange rates prevailing at the date of the transaction; monetary items are retranslated at the year-end rate.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These are only highlights of the key policies. The complete details of the accounting policies are presented in the notes to the financial statements.</p>
