I. Financial Performance:
The report shows strong financial performance in FY2024 despite global economic headwinds. Key highlights include:
Revenue Growth: Revenue from operations increased significantly to ₹204,966 million (14.4% growth) compared to ₹179,651 million in FY2023. This growth is noteworthy considering the global economic slowdown. Profitability: Profit Before Tax (PBT) rose substantially by 38.2% to ₹35,177 million, and Profit After Tax (PAT) increased by 39.4% to ₹26,651 million. Operating profit margins improved to 12.6% from 11.4% in FY2023. Order Intake: While new orders received decreased by 49.2% to ₹235,641 million compared to FY2023, this is largely attributed to a large, one-off order in the previous year. Excluding this, new orders showed a 14% increase, indicating sustained demand. Dividend: The Board recommended a dividend of ₹12 per share (600% of face value), a significant increase from ₹10 in the previous year. Return on Metrics: Return on Net Worth (RONW) improved significantly to 17.48% (FY23: 14.67%), and Return on Capital Employed (ROCE) also grew to 23.07% (FY23: 19.54%). These figures demonstrate efficient capital utilization and strong profitability. II. Business Segments:">

<p>This analysis looks into Siemens Limited&rsquo;s Annual Report for FY2023-24, examining its financial performance, business segments, identified risks, and ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) initiatives.</p>
<p><strong>I. Financial Performance:</strong></p>
<p>The report shows strong financial performance in FY2024 despite global economic headwinds. Key highlights include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Revenue Growth:</strong> Revenue from operations increased significantly to ₹204,966 million (14.4% growth) compared to ₹179,651 million in FY2023.  This growth is noteworthy considering the global economic slowdown.</li>
<li><strong>Profitability:</strong>  Profit Before Tax (PBT) rose substantially by 38.2% to ₹35,177 million, and Profit After Tax (PAT) increased by 39.4% to ₹26,651 million.  Operating profit margins improved to 12.6% from 11.4% in FY2023.</li>
<li><strong>Order Intake:</strong> While new orders received decreased by 49.2% to ₹235,641 million compared to FY2023, this is largely attributed to a large, one-off order in the previous year. Excluding this, new orders showed a 14% increase, indicating sustained demand.</li>
<li><strong>Dividend:</strong> The Board recommended a dividend of ₹12 per share (600% of face value), a significant increase from ₹10 in the previous year.</li>
<li><strong>Return on Metrics:</strong> Return on Net Worth (RONW) improved significantly to 17.48% (FY23: 14.67%), and Return on Capital Employed (ROCE) also grew to 23.07% (FY23: 19.54%).  These figures demonstrate efficient capital utilization and strong profitability.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>II. Business Segments:</strong></p>
<p>Siemens Limited operates across four key segments (with Low Voltage Motors now under Portfolio Companies):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Digital Industries (DI):</strong> Focuses on automation and digitalization solutions for various industries.  Despite a slight slowdown in orders due to normalized demand, the segment demonstrated success in implementing cutting-edge technologies, resulting in increased productivity and efficiency for clients.  Order and sales growth (excluding other operating revenue) were positive at 10.6% and 15.7% respectively.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Energy:</strong> A leader in energy technology, this segment provides solutions across the energy value chain.  It secured many marquee projects, notably in gas turbine modernization and high-voltage switchgear. This segment saw robust New Orders growth (29.9%) and sales growth (4.9%) year-over-year. The segment is slated for demerger into Siemens Energy India Limited in 2025.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Mobility:</strong> Offers intelligent transport solutions including rolling stock, rail automation, and electrification.  The segment secured significant orders, including electrification for Bengaluru Metro Phase 2, showcasing its strength in India&rsquo;s growing infrastructure sector. Despite a decrease in new orders due to project timing, sales witnessed a strong 38% surge.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Smart Infrastructure (SI):</strong> Focuses on grid infrastructure, industrial infrastructure, and urban infrastructure.  The segment saw considerable growth driven by demand in grid infrastructure, e-vehicle charging, data centers, and commercial buildings. The SI segment also announced substantial factory expansions, indicating a significant growth outlook.  Strong sales growth (18.6%) and increased new orders (11.6%) reflects this success.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Portfolio Companies:</strong>  This segment houses the Low Voltage Motors business, primarily motors of 0.12 kW to 1.25 MW.  While sales slightly decreased (-2.8%), it&rsquo;s essential to note that this is an asset-light model.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>III. Risks:</strong></p>
<p>The report highlights many key risks:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Global Economic Uncertainty:</strong>  The report acknowledges the impact of geopolitical tensions, interest rate fluctuations, and evolving trade dynamics on the global economy, which could affect order intake and profitability.</li>
<li><strong>Demerger of Energy Business:</strong> The planned demerger of the Energy business, while expected to unlock value, presents operational and regulatory risks during the transition.</li>
<li><strong>Competition:</strong>  Siemens faces intense competition in all its segments, requiring continuous innovation and strategic adaptability.</li>
<li><strong>Commodity Price Volatility:</strong> Fluctuations in the prices of key raw materials like copper, aluminum, and silver could impact profitability.  The company mitigates this through hedging strategies.</li>
<li><strong>Regulatory Changes:</strong> Changes in environmental, safety, and other regulations could impact operations and compliance costs.</li>
<li><strong>Cybersecurity and Data Privacy:</strong> Growing cyber threats and data protection concerns pose risks to operations and reputation.</li>
<li><strong>Supply Chain Disruptions:</strong> The report notes reliance on the supply chain, and disruptions due to geopolitical factors or other unforeseen events could impact operations.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>IV. ESG Initiatives:</strong></p>
<p>Siemens Limited demonstrates a strong commitment to ESG through its DEGREE framework (Decarbonization, Ethics, Governance, Resource Efficiency, Equity, Employability).  Key initiatives include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Decarbonization:</strong>  Siemens is committed to achieving net-zero emissions across its value chain by 2050. Significant investments were made in renewable energy sources (rooftop solar, offsite solar, renewable energy certificates) resulting in over 90% of its energy consumption from renewable sources in FY2024.  The company is also implementing energy efficiency measures at various sites.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Resource Efficiency:</strong>  The Company implemented many initiatives to reduce waste generation and increase recycling rates, especially focusing on plastic and e-waste (alignment with EPR requirements).  Sustainable sourcing is emphasized through a risk-based approach and engagement with suppliers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Equity and Inclusion:</strong> Siemens implemented initiatives to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) across its workforce, including specific programs for women&rsquo;s empowerment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Governance:</strong>  Strong corporate governance is highlighted through independent board committees, transparent reporting, and robust compliance mechanisms, including a whistleblower policy and Business Conduct Guidelines.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Ethics:</strong> The company emphasizes ethical conduct through training programs, fostering a culture of integrity and compliance, and maintaining zero tolerance for corruption.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Employability:</strong>  Siemens invests in employee development through training programs and career development initiatives, notably its scholarship program and focus on digital skills enhancement.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>V. Overall Assessment:</strong></p>
<p>Siemens Limited presented a strong financial performance in FY2024, demonstrating resilience amidst global challenges. The company is strategically positioned across various segments showing positive growth outlook.  While significant risks exist, especially related to the global economy and planned demerger, its strong financial foundation and commitment to ESG suggest a positive trajectory.  The company&rsquo;s detailed ESG initiatives and detailed reporting underscore its leadership role in sustainable business practices in India.  However, continuous monitoring of risks, especially supply chain vulnerabilities, global economic conditions, and successful completion of the demerger, will be essential for maintaining its growth momentum.  The impact of the demerger will require further detailed analysis in subsequent reports.</p>

<p>Based on Siemens Limited&rsquo;s standalone financial statements for FY2023-24:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Revenue:</strong> ₹204,966 million</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cost of Revenue:</strong> This isn&rsquo;t explicitly listed as a single line item.  However, we can approximate it by summing the relevant expense categories from the Statement of Profit and Loss:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cost of materials consumed: ₹39,526 million</li>
<li>Purchases of stock-in-trade: ₹55,099 million</li>
<li>Changes in inventories: ₹(567) million</li>
<li>Project bought outs and other direct costs: ₹44,892 million</li>
<li><strong>Approximate Cost of Revenue:</strong> ₹138,950 million</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Gross Profit:</strong>  This is calculated by subtracting the approximate cost of revenue from the revenue: ₹204,966 million - ₹138,950 million = ₹66,016 million</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Operating Expenses:</strong> This is the sum of expenses <em>excluding</em> cost of revenue, finance costs and taxes. Using the standalone statement of profit and loss:</p>
<ul>
<li>Employee benefits expense: ₹21,206 million</li>
<li>Depreciation and amortization expense: ₹2,301 million</li>
<li>Other expenses (net): ₹17,139 million</li>
<li><strong>Total Operating Expenses:</strong> ₹40,646 million</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Operating Income (Profit from operations):</strong>  This is calculated by subtracting operating expenses from gross profit: ₹66,016 million - ₹40,646 million = ₹25,370 million</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Considerations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Approximation:</strong> The cost of revenue is an <em>approximation</em> because the report doesn&rsquo;t explicitly categorize all direct costs in a single &ldquo;Cost of Revenue&rdquo; line.  The categorization used here is a reasonable interpretation, but might vary slightly depending on accounting standards applied.</li>
<li><strong>Rounding:</strong> All figures are rounded to the nearest million.  Precise figures would require the full, unredacted financial statements.</li>
</ul>
<p>The above calculations provide a reasonable estimate of the key financial metrics. However, for precise figures, refer to the detailed financial statements within the annual report itself.</p>
<h3 class="heading" id="bottom-line-metrics">
  Bottom Line Metrics
  <a class="anchor" href="#bottom-line-metrics">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Based on Siemens Limited&rsquo;s standalone financial statements for FY2023-24:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Net Income (Profit for the year):</strong> ₹26,651 million</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization):</strong> This needs to be calculated. Using the standalone Statement of Profit and Loss:</p>
<ul>
<li>Profit Before Tax (PBT): ₹35,177 million</li>
<li>Add back Depreciation and Amortization: ₹2,301 million</li>
<li>Add back Finance Costs: ₹582 million</li>
<li><strong>EBITDA:</strong> ₹38,060 million</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Basic EPS (Earnings Per Share):</strong> ₹74.84</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Diluted EPS (Earnings Per Share):</strong> ₹74.84 (The report indicates that basic and diluted EPS are the same).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Note:</strong>  These figures are extracted from the standalone financial statements and are rounded to the nearest Rupee for EPS and the nearest million for net income and EBITDA.  The precise figures might differ slightly depending on the level of precision in the original financial statements.</p>

<h3 class="heading" id="cash-flow-components">
  Cash Flow Components
  <a class="anchor" href="#cash-flow-components">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Based on Siemens Limited&rsquo;s standalone cash flow statement for FY2023-24 (in Indian Rupees, millions):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cash Flow from Operating Activities:</strong> ₹14,114 million</li>
<li><strong>Cash Flow from Investing Activities:</strong> ₹(3,910) million (negative, indicating net cash outflow)</li>
<li><strong>Cash Flow from Financing Activities:</strong> ₹(5,109) million (negative, indicating net cash outflow)</li>

<p>These figures are rounded to the nearest million.  Precise figures can be found in the original, unredacted cash flow statement within the annual report.</p>
<h3 class="heading" id="cash-flow-metrics">
  Cash Flow Metrics
  <a class="anchor" href="#cash-flow-metrics">#</a>
</h3>
<p>The Siemens Limited annual report doesn&rsquo;t directly provide a single-line item for &ldquo;Free Cash Flow&rdquo;.  However, we can calculate it using the information provided:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Capital Expenditure (CAPEX):</strong>  This isn&rsquo;t explicitly stated as a single figure.  We can approximate it from the Cash Flow from Investing Activities section.  The report shows ₹(3,125) million for &ldquo;Purchase of property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets,&rdquo; which is a reasonable proxy for CAPEX.  However, other investing activities could also be considered part of CAPEX (such as the acquisition of Mass-Tech), but a clear breakdown isn&rsquo;t available in the report excerpt.  Therefore, the approximation for CAPEX is ₹3,125 million (negative because it&rsquo;s an outflow).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dividends Paid:</strong> ₹3,561 million (This is explicitly stated in the report)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Free Cash Flow (FCF):</strong> FCF is typically calculated as operating cash flow less capital expenditures. Using our approximation for CAPEX:</p>
<ul>
<li>Operating Cash Flow: ₹14,114 million</li>
<li>Less CAPEX: ₹3,125 million</li>
<li><strong>Approximate FCF:</strong> ₹10,989 million</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Note:</strong> This FCF calculation is an <em>approximation</em>. A more precise calculation would require a more detailed breakdown of capital expenditures from the cash flow statement (including any other capital investments not explicitly mentioned in the excerpt) and potentially adjustments for changes in working capital.  The provided numbers are rounded to the nearest million.  Consult the complete financial statements for a definitive FCF number.</p>

<p>To calculate the profitability ratios for Siemens Limited in FY2023-24, we&rsquo;ll use the standalone financial statement figures, and note that some calculations require approximations due to the incomplete data provided in the report excerpt:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Gross Profit Margin:</strong> (Gross Profit / Revenue) * 100</p>
<ul>
<li>Gross Profit (approximated): ₹66,016 million (calculated previously)</li>
<li>Revenue: ₹204,966 million</li>
<li><strong>Gross Profit Margin:</strong> (₹66,016 million / ₹204,966 million) * 100 ≈ 32.2%</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Operating Profit Margin:</strong> (Operating Income / Revenue) * 100</p>
<ul>
<li>Operating Income (approximated): ₹25,370 million (calculated previously)</li>
<li>Revenue: ₹204,966 million</li>
<li><strong>Operating Profit Margin:</strong> (₹25,370 million / ₹204,966 million) * 100 ≈ 12.4%</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Net Profit Margin:</strong> (Net Income / Revenue) * 100</p>
<ul>
<li>Net Income: ₹26,651 million</li>
<li>Revenue: ₹204,966 million</li>
<li><strong>Net Profit Margin:</strong> (₹26,651 million / ₹204,966 million) * 100 ≈ 13.0%</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Return on Equity (ROE):</strong> (Net Income / Average Shareholders&rsquo; Equity) * 100</p>
<ul>
<li>Net Income: ₹26,651 million</li>
<li>Average Shareholders&rsquo; Equity:  This requires the beginning and ending shareholders&rsquo; equity values which are  ₹130,245 million and ₹152,470 million respectively. Average Shareholders&rsquo; equity = (₹130,245 million + ₹152,470 million) / 2 = ₹141,357.5 million.</li>
<li><strong>ROE:</strong> (₹26,651 million / ₹141,357.5 million) * 100 ≈ 18.8%</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Return on Assets (ROA):</strong> (Net Income / Average Total Assets) * 100</p>
<ul>
<li>Net Income: ₹26,651 million</li>
<li>Average Total Assets: This requires beginning and ending total assets. Using the values of ₹209,025 million and ₹243,805 million respectively, Average Total Assets = (₹209,025 million + ₹243,805 million) / 2 = ₹226,415 million.</li>
<li><strong>ROA:</strong> (₹26,651 million / ₹226,415 million) * 100 ≈ 11.8%</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Considerations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Approximations:</strong>  Some calculations rely on previously approximated figures (Gross Profit and Operating Income), which introduces a small margin of error.</li>
<li><strong>Rounding:</strong> All figures are rounded. The original financial statements should be used for precise calculations.</li>
<li><strong>Average Balances:</strong> ROE and ROA calculations utilize average equity and assets, respectively, which are calculated using the beginning and ending year values.</li>
</ul>
<p>These ratios provide a reasonable indication of Siemens Limited&rsquo;s profitability.  However, it&rsquo;s recommended to refer to the complete, unredacted financial statements for precise calculations and comparisons with industry benchmarks.</p>

  Liquidity Ratios
  <a class="anchor" href="#liquidity-ratios">#</a>
</h3>
<p>To calculate Siemens Limited&rsquo;s liquidity ratios for FY2023-24, we&rsquo;ll use the standalone financial statement figures from the annual report.  Remember that these are approximations due to rounding and the level of detail provided in the excerpt:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Current Ratio:</strong> (Current Assets / Current Liabilities)</p>
<ul>
<li>Current Assets: ₹188,987 million</li>
<li>Current Liabilities: ₹81,615 million</li>
<li><strong>Current Ratio:</strong> ₹188,987 million / ₹81,615 million ≈ 2.32</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Quick Ratio:</strong> [(Current Assets - Inventories) / Current Liabilities]</p>
<ul>
<li>Current Assets: ₹188,987 million</li>
<li>Inventories: ₹23,695 million</li>
<li>Current Liabilities: ₹81,615 million</li>
<li><strong>Quick Ratio:</strong> (₹188,987 million - ₹23,695 million) / ₹81,615 million ≈ 2.01</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cash Ratio:</strong> (Cash and Cash Equivalents / Current Liabilities)</p>
<ul>
<li>Cash and Cash Equivalents: ₹14,954 million</li>
<li>Current Liabilities: ₹81,615 million</li>
<li><strong>Cash Ratio:</strong> ₹14,954 million / ₹81,615 million ≈ 0.18</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Considerations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rounding:</strong> All figures are rounded to the nearest million. More precise values from the original financial statements are recommended for accurate analysis.</li>
</ul>
<p>These ratios offer insights into Siemens Limited&rsquo;s short-term debt-paying ability. However, a detailed liquidity assessment requires consideration of other factors beyond these basic ratios, such as cash flow forecasts, access to credit lines, and the overall business environment.  Comparing these ratios to industry averages and trends would further improve the interpretation of the company&rsquo;s liquidity position.</p>
<h3 class="heading" id="efficiency-ratios">
  Efficiency Ratios
  <a class="anchor" href="#efficiency-ratios">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Calculating Siemens Limited&rsquo;s efficiency ratios for FY2023-24 requires using figures from the standalone financial statements within the annual report.  We&rsquo;ll use the available data, noting that some calculations will be approximations due to the limited detail in the provided excerpt:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Asset Turnover:</strong> (Revenue / Average Total Assets)</p>
<ul>
<li>Revenue: ₹204,966 million</li>
<li>Average Total Assets:  Requires beginning and ending total assets. Using the reported values of ₹209,025 million and ₹243,805 million respectively, the average is (₹209,025 million + ₹243,805 million) / 2 = ₹226,415 million</li>
<li><strong>Asset Turnover:</strong> ₹204,966 million / ₹226,415 million ≈ 0.91</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Inventory Turnover:</strong> (Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory)</p>
<ul>
<li>Cost of Goods Sold (approximated): ₹138,950 million (calculated previously)</li>
<li>Average Inventory: Requires beginning and ending inventory values. Using the reported values of ₹22,605 million and ₹23,695 million respectively, the average is (₹22,605 million + ₹23,695 million) / 2 = ₹23,150 million</li>
<li><strong>Inventory Turnover:</strong> ₹138,950 million / ₹23,150 million ≈ 6.0</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Receivables Turnover:</strong> (Revenue / Average Accounts Receivable)</p>
<ul>
<li>Revenue: ₹204,966 million</li>
<li>Average Accounts Receivable: Requires beginning and ending accounts receivable.  The report provides a total for current and non-current receivables at the end of the year.  However, beginning-of-year figures are not provided.  Therefore, this calculation cannot be performed accurately with the excerpt provided.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Considerations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Approximations:</strong> The Cost of Goods Sold is an approximation, as discussed earlier. The Receivables Turnover cannot be calculated precisely without the beginning-of-year Accounts Receivable value.</li>
<li><strong>Rounding:</strong> All values are rounded to the nearest million.</li>
</ul>
<p>These ratios provide insights into how effectively Siemens Limited utilizes its assets to generate sales.  However, for precise calculations and meaningful comparison to industry benchmarks, it&rsquo;s essential to consult the complete, unredacted financial statements, including the beginning-of-year balance sheet figures.</p>
<h3 class="heading" id="leverage-ratios">
  Leverage Ratios
  <a class="anchor" href="#leverage-ratios">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Calculating Siemens Limited&rsquo;s use ratios for FY2023-24 presents challenges due to the limited information provided in the report excerpt.  There&rsquo;s no single line item for &ldquo;Total Debt,&rdquo; making direct calculation impossible. The report mentions lease liabilities and other financial liabilities, but these don&rsquo;t fully represent the entire debt picture.</p>
<p>To proceed, we will make the following assumptions and approximations:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Total Debt:</strong> We&rsquo;ll <em>approximate</em> total debt by summing the current and non-current lease liabilities and other financial liabilities.  This likely understates total debt if other financing sources aren&rsquo;t included in the excerpt.</p>
<ul>
<li>Non-current lease liabilities: ₹1,452 million</li>
<li>Current lease liabilities: ₹1,117 million</li>
<li>Non-current other financial liabilities: ₹624 million</li>
<li>Current other financial liabilities: ₹7,641 million</li>
<li><strong>Approximate Total Debt:</strong> ₹10,834 million</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Average Shareholder&rsquo;s Equity:</strong>  Calculated previously as ₹141,357.5 million.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Average Total Assets:</strong> Calculated previously as ₹226,415 million.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>With these approximations, we can estimate the use ratios:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Debt-to-Equity Ratio:</strong> (Total Debt / Average Shareholders&rsquo; Equity)</p>
<ul>
<li>Approximate Total Debt: ₹10,834 million</li>
<li>Average Shareholders&rsquo; Equity: ₹141,357.5 million</li>
<li><strong>Debt-to-Equity Ratio:</strong> ₹10,834 million / ₹141,357.5 million ≈ 0.08</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Debt-to-Assets Ratio:</strong> (Total Debt / Average Total Assets)</p>
<ul>
<li>Approximate Total Debt: ₹10,834 million</li>
<li>Average Total Assets: ₹226,415 million</li>
<li><strong>Debt-to-Assets Ratio:</strong> ₹10,834 million / ₹226,415 million ≈ 0.05</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Interest Coverage Ratio:</strong> (Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT) / Interest Expense)</p>
<ul>
<li>EBIT: This needs to be calculated from the profit and loss statement.  Profit Before Tax (PBT) is ₹35,177 million.  We need to add back the tax expense (₹8,526 million) to get EBIT of ₹43,703 million</li>
<li>Interest Expense: ₹582 million</li>
<li><strong>Interest Coverage Ratio:</strong> ₹43,703 million / ₹582 million ≈ 75.1</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Considerations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Significant Approximations:</strong> These calculations heavily rely on approximations, primarily because the complete debt structure isn&rsquo;t available in the report excerpt. The actual use ratios could be considerably different if other forms of debt exist.</li>
<li><strong>Rounding:</strong>  The figures used are rounded to the nearest million.</li>
<li><strong>Lease Liabilities:</strong> Lease liabilities are included in debt; however a detailed discussion regarding capital and operating leases is not included in the report excerpt.</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, while these ratios provide a <em>rough estimate</em>, they shouldn&rsquo;t be considered definitive. For accurate use ratio analysis, consult the full, unredacted financial statements, which would include a complete picture of all debt obligations.</p>

  Audit Information
  <a class="anchor" href="#audit-information">#</a>
</h3>
<p><strong>Auditor&rsquo;s Opinion:</strong></p>
<p>The independent auditor, Price Waterhouse Chartered Accountants LLP, expressed an unmodified (clean) opinion on both the standalone and consolidated financial statements of Siemens Limited for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024.  This means the auditors found the financial statements to be presented fairly and in accordance with the applicable accounting standards in India.  The report notes key audit matters relating to revenue recognition (particularly for construction contracts), related party transactions, and the assessment of provisions for warranty costs.  However, the auditors found no material misstatements in these areas.</p>
<p><strong>Key Accounting Policies:</strong></p>
<p>The annual report outlines many key accounting policies used by Siemens Limited in preparing its financial statements.  These policies are in accordance with Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS).  Key highlights include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Basis of Preparation:</strong>  The financial statements are prepared using the historical cost convention, except for certain items (like derivative instruments, defined benefit plans, and some financial assets/liabilities) measured at fair value.</li>
<li><strong>Current vs. Non-current Classification:</strong> Assets and liabilities are classified as current or non-current based on the company&rsquo;s operating cycle (12 months).</li>
<li><strong>Property, Plant, and Equipment:</strong>  These assets are reported at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives.</li>
<li><strong>Intangible Assets and Goodwill:</strong>  Intangible assets (software, technical know-how, etc.) are amortized over their estimated useful lives, while goodwill is tested annually for impairment.</li>
<li><strong>Revenue Recognition:</strong>  The company uses the principles of Ind AS 115 &ldquo;Revenue from Contracts with Customers,&rdquo; recognizing revenue over time for long-term contracts (using the input method based on percentage of completion) and at a point in time for other transactions.  Significant judgments are involved in estimating the transaction price, including variable considerations.</li>
<li><strong>Inventories:</strong>  Inventories are valued at the lower of cost (weighted average method) and net realizable value.</li>
<li><strong>Leases:</strong>  Ind AS 116 &ldquo;Leases&rdquo; is applied, recognizing right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for most leases.</li>
<li><strong>Employee Benefits:</strong>  Accounting for employee benefits follows Ind AS 19 &ldquo;Employee Benefits,&rdquo; distinguishing between defined contribution and defined benefit plans.  Actuarial valuations are used for defined benefit plans.</li>
<li><strong>Financial Instruments:</strong>  Ind AS 109 &ldquo;Financial Instruments&rdquo; is applied, classifying financial assets and liabilities into various categories (amortized cost, fair value through profit or loss, fair value through other detailed income) based on their characteristics and the company&rsquo;s business model.  The expected credit loss (ECL) model is used for impairment assessments.</li>
<li><strong>Foreign Currency Transactions:</strong> Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated using exchange rates prevailing at the transaction date, and any resulting exchange differences are recognized in the statement of profit and loss.  Hedging strategies are employed to mitigate foreign currency risk.</li>
<li><strong>Taxation:</strong>  Ind AS 12 &ldquo;Income Taxes&rdquo; is applied, recognizing both current and deferred tax.  The balance sheet method is used for deferred tax calculations.</li>
<li><strong>Provisions and Contingencies:</strong>  Ind AS 37 &ldquo;Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets&rdquo; is followed, recognizing provisions for probable obligations with reliable estimates and disclosing contingent liabilities.</li>
<li><strong>Share-based Payments:</strong> Ind AS 102 &ldquo;Share-based payment&rdquo; is applied. The cost of equity-settled transactions are recognized as an expense in the statement of profit or loss, together with a corresponding increase in equity.</li>
</ul>
<p>These  are  the  key  highlights;  the  complete  details  of  the  accounting  policies  are  presented  in  the  full annual report.  Understanding these policies is essential for a detailed analysis of the financial statements.</p>
