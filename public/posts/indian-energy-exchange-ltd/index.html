</ul>
<p><strong>II. Business Segments:</strong></p>

<li><strong>Green Market (G-DAM &amp; G-TAM):</strong> Experienced a decrease in volume (40% YoY decrease). Attributed to high prices and regulatory challenges.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>B. Certificate Segment:</strong></p>

</ul>
<p><strong>C. Indian Gas Exchange (IGX):</strong></p>

</ul>
<p><strong>IV. ESG Initiatives:</strong></p>
<p>IEX highlights its commitment to Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) principles.</p>
<p><strong>A. Environmental:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Carbon Neutrality:</strong> Maintained carbon-neutral status for the second consecutive year.  Achieved through market-based tradable instruments to offset its carbon emissions.</li>
<li><strong>Green Market Products:</strong> Facilitates trading of renewable energy through G-DAM, G-TAM, and RECs.</li>

<p><strong>B. Social:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Employee Welfare:</strong> Employee loan scheme, inclusion of spouses in annual health check-ups, IEX Academy reward scheme, and employee wellness programs.  Re-certified as a &ldquo;Great Place to Work&rdquo; for the second consecutive year.</li>

</ul>
<p><strong>C. Governance:</strong></p>
<ul>

Adherence to SEBI and CERC regulations.  Independent Director&rsquo;s evaluation of Non-Independent Directors, Chairman, and MD.  Transparency in reporting and disclosures.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>V. Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>IEX&rsquo;s Annual Report for FY2023-24 showcases significant financial growth and strategic expansion, driven by a robust business model and technological innovation.  The company’s proactive risk management approach and strong commitment to ESG principles highlight its long-term vision for sustainable and responsible growth in India&rsquo;s evolving energy landscape. While the Green Market faces challenges, the overall performance demonstrates IEX&rsquo;s position as a key player in India&rsquo;s energy transition. The focus on technology and customer centricity, coupled with strategic investments in new market segments like gas and carbon trading, positions the company for continued success in the years to come.  However,  continued monitoring of regulatory changes and  mitigation of cybersecurity threats remain essential for sustained growth.</p>

<p>The provided annual report gives the following values for IEX&rsquo;s assets, all figures are in Indian Rupees (₹) in Lakhs:</p>
<p><strong>Standalone Financial Statements:</strong></p>
<ul>

<li><strong>Current Assets:</strong> ₹118,111.01</li>
<li><strong>Cash and Cash Equivalents:</strong> ₹14,780.12</li>
<li><strong>Accounts Receivable (Trade Receivables):</strong> ₹8,627.32</li>
<li><strong>Inventory:</strong>  Not applicable.  IEX is a service company, not a manufacturer, therefore it does not hold inventory.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Consolidated Financial Statements:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Total Assets:</strong> ₹177,365.99</li>
<li><strong>Current Assets:</strong> ₹118,364.98</li>
<li><strong>Cash and Cash Equivalents:</strong> ₹14,790.29</li>
<li><strong>Accounts Receivable (Trade Receivables):</strong> ₹8,627.32</li>
<li><strong>Inventory:</strong> Not applicable.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please note that these figures are extracted directly from the provided financial statements and may require further analysis depending on your specific needs.  The consolidated figures reflect the inclusion of IEX&rsquo;s subsidiaries and associate company.</p>
<h3 class="heading" id="liability-analysis">
  Liability Analysis
  <a class="anchor" href="#liability-analysis">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a breakdown of IEX&rsquo;s liabilities from the provided annual report, all figures are in Indian Rupees (₹) in Lakhs:</p>
<p><strong>Standalone Financial Statements:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Total Liabilities:</strong> ₹80,096.18</li>
<li><strong>Current Liabilities:</strong> ₹75,112.16</li>
<li><strong>Long-Term Debt:</strong>  The report doesn&rsquo;t explicitly state long-term debt as a separate line item.  However, long-term lease liabilities are included within non-current liabilities (₹615.47). Other financial liabilities (₹178.60) and deferred tax liabilities (₹3,072.15) are also components of the non-current liabilities.</li>
<li><strong>Accounts Payable (Trade Payables):</strong> ₹56,257.30 (This excludes amounts due to micro and small enterprises, which are separately stated as ₹8.18).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Consolidated Financial Statements:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Total Liabilities:</strong> ₹80,148.86</li>
<li><strong>Current Liabilities:</strong> ₹75,136.46</li>
<li><strong>Long-Term Debt:</strong> Similar to the standalone statements, long-term debt isn&rsquo;t explicitly listed. Non-current liabilities include long-term lease liabilities (₹615.47), other financial liabilities (₹178.60), and deferred tax liabilities (₹3,072.15).</li>
<li><strong>Accounts Payable (Trade Payables):</strong> ₹56,257.70 (This also excludes amounts due to micro and small enterprises, listed separately as ₹9.68).</li>
</ul>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to note that the consolidated figures include the liabilities of IEX&rsquo;s subsidiaries and associate company.  The  breakdown  of  &ldquo;Other financial liabilities&rdquo; and  &ldquo;Other liabilities&rdquo; requires a detailed review of the notes to the financial statements to identify their specific components.  There&rsquo;s no long-term debt reported in the traditional sense;  lease obligations represent the primary form of long-term financial liability.</p>
<h3 class="heading" id="equity-analysis">
  Equity Analysis
  <a class="anchor" href="#equity-analysis">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the breakdown of shareholders&rsquo; equity, retained earnings, and share capital for IEX, all figures are in Indian Rupees (₹) in Lakhs:</p>
<p><strong>Standalone Financial Statements:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shareholders&rsquo; Equity:</strong> ₹94,818.71</li>
<li><strong>Retained Earnings:</strong> ₹84,211.37</li>
<li><strong>Share Capital:</strong> ₹8,908.71  (This is the paid-up share capital, net of shares held by the IEX ESOP Trust).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Consolidated Financial Statements:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shareholders&rsquo; Equity:</strong> ₹97,217.13 (Attributable to shareholders of the Company)</li>
<li><strong>Retained Earnings:</strong> ₹86,609.79 (Attributable to shareholders of the Company)</li>
<li><strong>Share Capital:</strong> ₹8,908.71 (The share capital remains the same in the consolidated statements as it only represents IEX&rsquo;s own share capital, not that of its subsidiaries or associate).</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember that the consolidated figures differ because they incorporate the equity of subsidiaries and the associate company, while the standalone figures represent only IEX&rsquo;s own equity.  The &ldquo;Other Equity&rdquo; section within the equity accounts requires further review of the notes to the financial statements to understand its various components (e.g., Employee Stock Options, ESOP Trust Reserve, Capital Redemption Reserve).</p>

<h3 class="heading" id="operating-performance">

</h3>
<p>The IEX annual report doesn&rsquo;t explicitly break down the income statement into &ldquo;Cost of Revenue&rdquo; and &ldquo;Gross Profit&rdquo; in the way a typical manufacturing company would.  This is because IEX is a service company; its primary revenue comes from transaction fees, membership fees, and other service charges, not the sale of goods.  Therefore, the concept of &ldquo;Cost of Revenue&rdquo; as a distinct expense category before gross profit calculation isn&rsquo;t directly applicable.</p>
<p>Instead, the report presents the income statement using the following structure (₹ in Lakhs):</p>
<p><strong>Standalone Financial Statements:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Revenue from Operations:</strong> ₹44,915.32</li>
<li><strong>Other Income:</strong> ₹10,162.84</li>
<li><strong>Total Revenue (Revenue from Operations + Other Income):</strong> ₹55,078.16</li>
<li><strong>Operating Expenses:</strong> ₹6,386.11 (This includes employee benefits, other operating expenses, and CSR expenses)</li>
<li><strong>Operating Income (Total Revenue - Operating Expenses):</strong> ₹48,692.05 (This is calculated as Total Revenue minus the specific operating expenses detailed in the report).  The report doesn&rsquo;t explicitly label this line as &ldquo;Operating Income&rdquo;, but this is the equivalent calculation.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Consolidated Financial Statements:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Revenue from Operations:</strong> ₹44,915.32</li>
<li><strong>Other Income:</strong> ₹10,169.52</li>
<li><strong>Total Revenue (Revenue from Operations + Other Income):</strong> ₹55,084.84</li>
<li><strong>Operating Expenses:</strong> ₹9,560.30 (This also includes employee benefits, other operating expenses, and CSR expenses)</li>
<li><strong>Operating Income (Total Revenue - Operating Expenses):</strong> ₹45,524.54 (Again, this is a calculated figure representing the equivalent of operating income for IEX&rsquo;s structure).</li>
</ul>
<p>The  differences between standalone and consolidated results are due to the inclusion of subsidiary and associate company performance in the consolidated figures.  It is important to note that the provided figures for Operating Expenses encompass all operational costs reported in the provided financial statements and the calculations for &ldquo;Operating Income&rdquo; are derived based on the presentation style of IEX&rsquo;s annual report.  This differs from the standard &ldquo;Cost of Revenue/Goods Sold&rdquo; followed in other business models.</p>
<h3 class="heading" id="bottom-line-metrics">
  Bottom Line Metrics
  <a class="anchor" href="#bottom-line-metrics">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a summary of IEX&rsquo;s net income, EBITDA, basic EPS, and diluted EPS, all figures are in Indian Rupees (₹) in Lakhs unless otherwise noted:</p>
<p><strong>Standalone Financial Statements:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Net Income (PAT):</strong> ₹34144.06</li>
<li><strong>EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization):</strong>  Not explicitly provided. This requires calculation using the data provided:  Revenue (₹55078.16) - Operating Expenses (₹6386.11) - Depreciation &amp; Amortization (₹2044.29) = ₹46647.76 Lakhs.</li>
<li><strong>Basic EPS:</strong> ₹3.84 per share</li>
<li><strong>Diluted EPS:</strong> ₹3.84 per share</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Consolidated Financial Statements:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Net Income (PAT):</strong> ₹35078.26</li>
<li><strong>EBITDA:</strong>  Not explicitly provided.  Calculation required: Revenue (₹55084.84) - Operating Expenses (₹9560.30) - Depreciation &amp; Amortization (₹2047.37) = ₹43477.17 Lakhs.</li>
<li><strong>Basic EPS:</strong> ₹3.94 per share</li>
<li><strong>Diluted EPS:</strong> ₹3.94 per share</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that the EBITDA figures are calculated based on the information provided in the report.  The report itself doesn&rsquo;t explicitly present EBITDA as a separate line item.  Also, remember the difference between standalone and consolidated figures is due to the inclusion of subsidiary and associate company results in the consolidated statements.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a summary of IEX&rsquo;s cash flows from operations, investing, and financing activities, all figures are in Indian Rupees (₹) in Lakhs:</p>
<p><strong>Standalone Statement of Cash Flows:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cash Flow from Operating Activities:</strong> ₹30,014.95</li>
<li><strong>Cash Flow from Investing Activities:</strong> ₹(2,616.41)  (Negative indicates net cash outflow)</li>
<li><strong>Cash Flow from Financing Activities:</strong> ₹(18,308.64) (Negative indicates net cash outflow)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cash Flow from Operating Activities:</strong> ₹29,846.04</li>
<li><strong>Cash Flow from Investing Activities:</strong> ₹(2,449.81) (Negative indicates net cash outflow)</li>
<li><strong>Cash Flow from Financing Activities:</strong> ₹(18,308.65) (Negative indicates net cash outflow)</li>
</ul>
<p>The  differences between standalone and consolidated figures are due to the inclusion of subsidiary and associate company cash flows in the consolidated statement.  Note that negative values indicate net cash outflows during the period.  Review of the detailed notes within each cash flow statement would be necessary to gain a complete understanding of the specific transactions contributing to these figures.</p>

  Cash Flow Metrics
  <a class="anchor" href="#cash-flow-metrics">#</a>
</h3>
<p>The provided annual report doesn&rsquo;t directly state &ldquo;Free Cash Flow&rdquo; as a separate line item.  Free cash flow is a calculated metric, and to determine it accurately for IEX, we need more information than what&rsquo;s readily available in the report&rsquo;s summary sections.  A precise calculation requires detailed line items within the cash flow statement and balance sheet, information not fully provided in the summary.</p>
<p>However, we can approximate some of the components:</p>
<p><strong>Capital Expenditure (CAPEX):</strong></p>
<p>This is not explicitly provided as a single number.  Looking at the Standalone Statement of Cash Flows, under &ldquo;Cash flows from investing activities,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Purchase of Property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets&rdquo; represents a major component of CAPEX.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Standalone:</strong> ₹1,395.98 Lakhs (outflow)</li>
<li><strong>Consolidated:</strong> ₹1,529.91 Lakhs (outflow)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Dividends Paid:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Standalone:</strong> The report states ₹17,833.86 Lakhs were used for dividend payments (interim and final for the previous fiscal year, and interim for FY24).</li>
<li><strong>Consolidated:</strong> The consolidated statement doesn&rsquo;t directly show dividend paid;  this would require tracing the cash outflow through the detailed notes and reconciling with the standalone figure.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Free Cash Flow (FCF) Approximation:</strong></p>
<p>A common, although simplified, approximation of free cash flow is:</p>
<p>FCF ≈ Operating Cash Flow - Capital Expenditures</p>
<p>Using this approximation and the available data:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Standalone:</strong> ₹30,014.95 - ₹1,395.98 ≈ ₹28,618.97 Lakhs</li>
<li><strong>Consolidated:</strong> ₹29,846.04 - ₹1,529.91 ≈ ₹28,316.13 Lakhs</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Considerations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>These FCF calculations are <em>approximations</em>.  A true FCF calculation would need to account for other factors such as changes in working capital (which are already partially reflected in the Operating Cash Flow).</li>
<li>The report may contain more precise details on CAPEX within the notes to the financial statements.</li>
<li>The consolidated FCF calculation requires a more in-depth analysis of the consolidated cash flow statement to account for all subsidiary and associate activities.</li>
</ul>
<p>To obtain a precise FCF figure, a more thorough examination of the full financial statements and related notes is necessary.</p>

<p>As previously noted, IEX, being a service company, doesn&rsquo;t present its financial statements using the standard &ldquo;Cost of Goods Sold&rdquo; and &ldquo;Gross Profit&rdquo; format typical of manufacturing companies. Therefore, a precise &ldquo;Gross Margin&rdquo; cannot be calculated directly from the provided data.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what we can calculate from the provided information (all percentages are rounded).  All values are from the Standalone Financial Statements unless otherwise noted:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Operating Margin:</strong>  This is calculated as Operating Income / Total Revenue.  Remember that Operating Income needs to be calculated as Total Revenue less directly stated Operating Expenses.</p>
<ul>
<li>Standalone: (₹48,692.05 / ₹55,078.16) * 100% ≈ 88.4%</li>
<li>Consolidated: (₹45,524.54 / ₹55,084.84) * 100% ≈ 82.6%</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Net Profit Margin:</strong> This is calculated as Net Income / Total Revenue.</p>
<ul>
<li>Standalone: (₹34,144.06 / ₹55,078.16) * 100% ≈ 62.0%</li>
<li>Consolidated: (₹35,078.26 / ₹55,084.84) * 100% ≈ 63.7%</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Return on Equity (ROE):</strong> This is calculated as Net Income / Average Shareholders&rsquo; Equity.  We need the beginning and ending shareholders&rsquo; equity to compute the average. The report provides this data.  The average is calculated as (Beginning Equity + Ending Equity) / 2.</p>
<ul>
<li>Standalone:  (₹34,144.06 / [(₹78,446.45 + ₹94,818.71) / 2]) * 100% ≈ 36.4%</li>
<li>Consolidated:  (₹35,078.26 / [(₹79,909.60 + ₹97,217.13) / 2]) * 100% ≈ 36.4%</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Return on Assets (ROA):</strong> This is calculated as Net Income / Average Total Assets.  Similar to ROE, we need beginning and ending total assets.</p>
<ul>
<li>Standalone: (₹34,144.06 / [(₹143,875.35 + ₹174,914.89) / 2]) * 100% ≈ 23.2%</li>
<li>Consolidated: (₹35,078.26 / [(₹145,340.98 + ₹177,365.99) / 2]) * 100% ≈ 23.1%</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Notes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>No Gross Margin:</strong> As explained previously, the nature of IEX&rsquo;s business as a service provider makes a traditional gross margin calculation irrelevant.  The provided operating margin effectively serves as a key profitability measure in its place.</li>
<li><strong>Approximations:</strong> The ROE and ROA calculations are based on the assumption that the equity and asset values remain constant throughout the financial year. In reality, these values fluctuate, potentially impacting the final calculated values.  More precise calculation of these requires quarterly data and more detailed accounting information.</li>
<li><strong>Consolidated vs. Standalone:</strong> The consolidated ratios are affected by the inclusion of the subsidiary and associate. The values would be lower than standalone values because the inclusion of losses in the subsidiary reduces the overall net profit and increases the overall expenses.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="heading" id="liquidity-ratios">
  Liquidity Ratios
  <a class="anchor" href="#liquidity-ratios">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a calculation of the liquidity ratios for IEX using the data from the Standalone and Consolidated Balance Sheets.  All figures are in Indian Rupees (₹) in Lakhs.</p>
<p><strong>Standalone Financial Statements:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Current Ratio:</strong> Current Assets / Current Liabilities</p>
<ul>
<li>Current Ratio: ₹118,111.01 / ₹75,112.16 ≈ 1.57</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Quick Ratio (Acid-Test Ratio):</strong> (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities.  Since IEX has no inventory, the Quick Ratio is the same as the Current Ratio.</p>
<ul>
<li>Quick Ratio: ₹118,111.01 / ₹75,112.16 ≈ 1.57</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cash Ratio:</strong> (Cash and Cash Equivalents) / Current Liabilities</p>
<ul>
<li>Cash Ratio: ₹14,780.12 / ₹75,112.16 ≈ 0.20</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Consolidated Financial Statements:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Current Ratio:</strong> Current Assets / Current Liabilities</p>
<ul>
<li>Current Ratio: ₹118,364.98 / ₹75,136.46 ≈ 1.58</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Quick Ratio:</strong> (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities. Again, with no inventory, the Quick Ratio equals the Current Ratio.</p>
<ul>
<li>Quick Ratio: ₹118,364.98 / ₹75,136.46 ≈ 1.58</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cash Ratio:</strong> (Cash and Cash Equivalents) / Current Liabilities</p>
<ul>
<li>Cash Ratio: ₹14,790.29 / ₹75,136.46 ≈ 0.20</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Note:</strong> These calculations are based on the year-end figures from the balance sheet.  Liquidity can fluctuate throughout the year. The consolidated ratios include the current assets and liabilities of the subsidiary and associate companies.  The standalone ratios represent only IEX&rsquo;s own financial position.</p>
<h3 class="heading" id="efficiency-ratios">
  Efficiency Ratios
  <a class="anchor" href="#efficiency-ratios">#</a>
</h3>
<p>IEX&rsquo;s business model as a service provider means some standard efficiency ratios, especially those related to inventory, are not directly applicable.  Let&rsquo;s look at what we <em>can</em> calculate using the information provided in the Standalone Financial Statements (Consolidated data would require a more detailed breakdown not present in the summary):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Asset Turnover:</strong>  Revenue / Average Total Assets</p>
<ul>
<li>To calculate the average total assets, we need the beginning and ending total assets values from the balance sheet: (₹143,875.35 + ₹174,914.89) / 2 ≈ ₹159,395.12</li>
<li>Asset Turnover: ₹55,078.16 / ₹159,395.12 ≈ 0.35x</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Inventory Turnover:</strong> This ratio is not applicable to IEX, as it doesn&rsquo;t hold inventory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Receivables Turnover:</strong> Revenue / Average Accounts Receivable</p>
<ul>
<li>First, calculate the average accounts receivable: (₹703.38 + ₹8,627.32) / 2 ≈ ₹4,665.35</li>
<li>Receivables Turnover: ₹55,078.16 / ₹4,665.35 ≈ 11.8x</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Notes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Simplified Calculations:</strong> These turnover ratios use year-end values for assets and receivables. More accurate calculations would require average values determined from quarterly or monthly data, reflecting fluctuations throughout the year.</li>
<li><strong>No Inventory:</strong>  As a service company, IEX doesn&rsquo;t have inventory, rendering that turnover ratio inapplicable.</li>
<li><strong>Standalone Data Only:</strong> These calculations are based on the standalone financial statements.  Consolidated figures would require a more detailed breakdown of subsidiary and associate performance and would be likely lower than the standalone results.  This is because the consolidated revenue will include that from subsidiaries and associate companies and the total assets for such entities.</li>
<li><strong>Interpretation:</strong>  The asset turnover ratio suggests that for every ₹1 of assets, the company generates ₹0.35 in revenue.  The receivables turnover indicates that the company collects its receivables approximately 11.8 times per year.  These are high-level insights; a more detailed analysis including industry benchmarks is necessary for complete interpretation.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="heading" id="leverage-ratios">
  Leverage Ratios
  <a class="anchor" href="#leverage-ratios">#</a>
</h3>
<p>IEX&rsquo;s financial statements don&rsquo;t report long-term debt in the traditional sense (e.g., bonds, loans).  The primary long-term liability shown is lease obligations.  Therefore, standard use ratios that rely on a &ldquo;debt&rdquo; figure need to be interpreted carefully, and some may not be meaningfully calculated.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s analyze what we can determine from the Standalone Financial Statements (Consolidated figures would require a more thorough breakdown of the liabilities of subsidiaries and associate companies):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Debt-to-Equity Ratio:</strong> Total Debt / Shareholders&rsquo; Equity.  Because there&rsquo;s no traditional long-term debt reported separately, we need to decide how to define &ldquo;Total Debt.&rdquo; One approach is to use the total liabilities (both current and non-current) as a proxy. This is only an approximation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Total Liabilities (Standalone): ₹80,096.18 Lakhs</li>
<li>Shareholders&rsquo; Equity (Standalone): ₹94,818.71 Lakhs</li>
<li>Debt-to-Equity Ratio (using total liabilities as proxy): ₹80,096.18 / ₹94,818.71 ≈ 0.85x</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Debt-to-Assets Ratio:</strong> Total Debt / Total Assets. Again, using total liabilities as a proxy for total debt:</p>
<ul>
<li>Total Liabilities (Standalone): ₹80,096.18 Lakhs</li>
<li>Total Assets (Standalone): ₹174,914.89 Lakhs</li>
<li>Debt-to-Assets Ratio (using total liabilities as proxy): ₹80,096.18 / ₹174,914.89 ≈ 0.46x</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Interest Coverage Ratio:</strong> Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT) / Interest Expense.</p>
<ul>
<li>EBIT (Standalone - calculated):  ₹45,684.90 Lakhs (PBT) + ₹283.48 Lakhs (Interest Expense) = ₹45,968.38 Lakhs</li>
<li>Interest Expense (Standalone): ₹283.48 Lakhs</li>
<li>Interest Coverage Ratio: ₹45,968.38 / ₹283.48 ≈ 162x</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Considerations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lease Obligations:</strong> The significant lease obligations are not explicitly categorized as debt but are a substantial component of the company&rsquo;s liabilities.  A more refined analysis might exclude these from the &ldquo;Debt&rdquo; portion of the use calculations.</li>
<li><strong>Proxy for Debt:</strong> Using total liabilities as a proxy for debt is a simplification that could significantly skew the results. The true debt levels are low, but the inclusion of lease liabilities and other provisions increase the calculated use significantly.</li>
<li><strong>Standalone vs. Consolidated:</strong> The use ratios calculated above are based only on IEX&rsquo;s standalone financial statements.  Consolidated figures would reflect the debt and equity of its subsidiaries and associate.  These are likely to be significantly different due to the inclusion of liabilities in associated companies, which will increase overall liability and hence increase the leverage.</li>
</ul>
<p>For a truly detailed use analysis, further investigation of the notes to the financial statements and a clearer understanding of the company&rsquo;s financing structure is needed.  The relatively high interest coverage ratio suggests IEX&rsquo;s ability to meet its interest obligations but doesn&rsquo;t fully reflect the extent of overall liabilities because of the exclusion of non-traditional debt.</p>

<p>The annual report doesn&rsquo;t directly provide the Market Cap, PE ratio, PB ratio, and dividend yield.  These are market-based metrics requiring information not included in the report itself (specifically the current market price of IEX shares and the number of outstanding shares).</p>
<p>However, we can calculate the <strong>dividend payout ratio</strong> using the information given in the report:</p>
<p><strong>Dividend Payout Ratio:</strong> Total Dividends Paid / Net Income</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Standalone:</strong>  The report mentions total dividends paid of ₹22,292.32 Lakhs (this includes interim and final dividend for FY24).  Using the standalone Net Income of ₹34,144.06 Lakhs.</p>
<ul>
<li>Dividend Payout Ratio (Standalone): ₹22,292.32 / ₹34,144.06 ≈ 65.3%</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Consolidated:</strong> The report doesn&rsquo;t state consolidated dividends paid directly.  This would require reviewing the detailed cash flow statement.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>To obtain the other market-based metrics (Market Cap, PE ratio, PB ratio, and dividend yield):</strong> You will need to obtain the following information from a financial website such as Google Finance, Yahoo Finance, or Bloomberg:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Current Market Price:</strong> The current trading price of IEX&rsquo;s shares.</li>
<li><strong>Number of Outstanding Shares:</strong> The total number of IEX shares currently in circulation.</li>
</ol>
<p>With this information, you can calculate:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Market Cap:</strong> Current Market Price * Number of Outstanding Shares</li>
<li><strong>Price-to-Earnings Ratio (PE Ratio):</strong> Current Market Price / Earnings Per Share (EPS)</li>
<li><strong>Price-to-Book Ratio (PB Ratio):</strong> Current Market Price / Book Value Per Share (Net Assets/Number of Outstanding Shares)</li>
<li><strong>Dividend Yield:</strong> (Annual Dividend Per Share / Current Market Price) * 100%</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember that these market-based metrics are dynamic and change constantly depending on the current market price of the shares.  The dividend payout ratio, however, is based on the financial year&rsquo;s reported results and remains constant.</p>

  Audit Information
  <a class="anchor" href="#audit-information">#</a>
</h3>
<p><strong>Auditor&rsquo;s Opinion:</strong></p>
<p>The independent auditor&rsquo;s report (B S R &amp; Associates LLP) expresses an <strong>unmodified (clean) opinion</strong> on both the standalone and consolidated financial statements of Indian Energy Exchange Limited (IEX) for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024.  This means the auditors found the financial statements to be presented fairly, in accordance with Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS), and free from material misstatements.  The report does, however, identify &ldquo;Revenue Recognition&rdquo; as a Key Audit Matter due to the regulatory nature of IEX&rsquo;s business and the potential for revenue overstatement.  The audit procedures implemented to address this risk are detailed in the report.</p>
<p><strong>Key Accounting Policies:</strong></p>
<p>The annual report outlines many key accounting policies followed by IEX, consistent with Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS).  Key highlights include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Property, Plant, and Equipment (PP&amp;E):</strong>  Initial recognition at cost, subsequent expenditure capitalized only if probable future economic benefits and reliable measurement are ensured, depreciation calculated using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives.</li>
<li><strong>Intangible Assets:</strong>  Similar to PP&amp;E, initial recognition at cost if probable future economic benefits and reliable measurement are met;  amortization using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives.  Intangible assets under development are capitalized until ready for use.</li>
<li><strong>Financial Instruments:</strong>  Classified and measured based on Ind AS 109, using the amortized cost method, fair value through other detailed income (FVTOCI), or fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) as appropriate for each instrument.  Impairment is recognized based on expected credit loss (ECL) models.</li>
<li><strong>Revenue Recognition:</strong>  Ind AS 115 compliant, recognizing revenue upon fulfillment of performance obligations.  Transaction fees are recognized at various points depending on the market segment and delivery of services.</li>
<li><strong>Employee Benefits:</strong>  Covers short-term benefits, defined contribution plans (Provident Fund, NPS), defined benefit plans (gratuity), and share-based payments.  Defined benefit plans are valued actuarially.</li>
<li><strong>Impairment of Non-Financial Assets:</strong>  Assets are tested for impairment at each reporting date; recoverable amount is determined as the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use.</li>
<li><strong>Foreign Currency Transactions:</strong>  Translated at the exchange rate at the transaction date or average rate.</li>
<li><strong>Leases:</strong> Ind AS 17 compliant, classifying and accounting for leases as operating leases.  Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are recognized for most lease arrangements.</li>
<li><strong>Income Tax:</strong>  Recognizes current and deferred tax based on enacted or substantively enacted tax rates.</li>
<li><strong>Operating Segments:</strong>  The company operates under a single operating segment, given its focus on a unified exchange platform.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are just the highlights.  The detailed notes to the financial statements provide a more thorough explanation of each accounting policy and its application.  The auditor&rsquo;s report emphasizes the importance of applying these policies consistently and making reasonable judgments and estimations in preparing the financial statements.</p>
