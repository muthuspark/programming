<li><strong>Likelihood:</strong> Medium. The document notes a &ldquo;softening of the market situation&rdquo; in Media &amp; Communications.</li>

<li><strong>Mitigation Strategies:</strong> Vertical and client diversification efforts show a mixed result. The shift in focus is resulting in significant revenue increase from operators (70% of vertical&rsquo;s total business.)</li>
<li><strong>Control Effectiveness:</strong> Partially Effective. The Company needs to demonstrate greater progress in mitigation given the rising concentration risk.</li>
