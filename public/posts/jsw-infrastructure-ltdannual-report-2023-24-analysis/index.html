<li><strong>Severity:</strong> High, due to the capital-intensive nature of the port infrastructure business and dependence on long-term concession agreements. The company aims to more than double capacity by FY2030.</li>
<li><strong>Likelihood:</strong> Medium, as strategic risks are influenced by economic cycles, government policies, and competitive pressures.</li>
<li><strong>Trend:</strong> Increasing, The stated ambition is &ldquo;to more than double our capacity to 400 MTPA by FY2030 or even earlier.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Mitigation Strategies:</strong> Diversification of cargo mix (targeting a 50-50 split between JSW Group and third-party customers), expansion into new geographies and business segments (liquid storage, acquisitions), pursuit of brownfield and greenfield projects, and securing long-term contracts.</li>
<li><strong>Control Effectiveness:</strong> Partially effective, demonstrated by successful acquisitions (liquid storage terminal in Fujairah, PNP Port) and securing new projects (Keni Port, Tuticorin terminal, JNPT liquid berths).</li>
<li><strong>Potential Financial Impact:</strong> Significant capital expenditures are planned. The successful execution of expansion plans is critical to revenue growth and maintaining profitability. Delays or cost overruns could materially affect financial performance.</li>

<li><strong>Likelihood:</strong> Medium. Ports inherently face operational risks.</li>
<li><strong>Trend:</strong> Stable to increasing, linked to the scale of operations. For example, there&rsquo;s an increase in the operational capacity to 55 MTPA with seven berths.</li>
<li><strong>Mitigation Strategies:</strong> Investment in mechanized cargo handling systems, multi-modal evacuation channels, safety protocols (evidenced by British Safety Council 5-star rating for Jaigarh Port), and technological upgrades (steel barcoding, energy management systems).</li>
<li><strong>Control Effectiveness:</strong> Appears good, suggested by awards and certifications, such as Jaigarh Port&rsquo;s 5-star rating and various &ldquo;Grow Care India 2023&rdquo; awards.</li>

  Accounting Quality and Regulatory Risk Assessment

<li><strong>Accounting Quality:</strong> The unmodified audit opinion and the auditor&rsquo;s statement on the effectiveness of internal financial controls suggest a relatively high quality of accounting. The use of Ind AS, detailed disclosures, and adherence to established accounting principles further support this.</li>
<li><strong>Regulatory Risk:</strong> The Company&rsquo;s disclosures indicate a commitment to regulatory compliance. The absence of reported fraud, pending IBC proceedings, or one-time settlements suggests a lower regulatory risk profile. The listing on BSE and NSE, and compliance with SEBI regulations, indicates a generally robust regulatory standing. The contingent liabilities related to tax disputes represent a potential, but managed, regulatory risk. The consistent use of an internal audit function enhances the regulatory risk profile.</li>
