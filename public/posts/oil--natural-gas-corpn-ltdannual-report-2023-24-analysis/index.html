  Scenario Analysis and Sensitivity to Key Assumptions
  <a class="anchor" href="#scenario-analysis-and-sensitivity-to-key-assumptions">#</a>
</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Oil and Gas Price Volatility:</strong> Sensitivity analysis shows that revenue from operations is highly sensitive to changes in crude oil, natural gas, and VAP prices. A +/- â¹1 change in price impacts revenue by â¹55,166.29 million.</li>
<li><strong>Interest Rate Risk:</strong> A 50 basis point change in interest rates would impact profit or loss by +/- â¹32.13 million.</li>
<li><strong>Discount Rate Sensitivity:</strong> Decommissioning provisions are sensitive to changes in discount rates.</li>
<li><strong>Exchange Rate Fluctuations:</strong> The company is exposed to currency risk, particularly against the USD. A 5% change in the USD-INR exchange rate could impact profit or loss.</li>
<li><strong>ESG Risk and Carbon Management:</strong> Reduce emmissions and eliminate routine flaring on all operations.</li>

  Analysis of Accounting Quality and Regulatory Risk Assessment
  <a class="anchor" href="#analysis-of-accounting-quality-and-regulatory-risk-assessment">#</a>
</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Accounting Quality:</strong> The use of estimates (e.g., decommissioning costs, reserves, impairment) introduces inherent uncertainty. The reliance on management&rsquo;s technical/commercial evaluations and the use of unaudited statements for some Joint Operations introduces a risk of inaccuracy. The change in accounting policy for scrap material, while prospectively applied due to immateriality, should be noted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Regulatory Risk:</strong> The Company operates in a highly regulated industry. Disputes with tax and regulatory authorities, as well as ongoing legal proceedings, present potential financial and operational risks. Compliance with environmental regulations and the transition to cleaner energy sources pose both challenges and opportunities. The windfall profit taxes introduced by the Government of India highlight the risk of regulatory changes impacting profitability.</p>
