</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Severity:</strong> Potentially high, given the company&rsquo;s stated ambition to significantly increase its 4-wheeler and non-automotive segment share by 2030, and expansion into Battery Management Systems (BMS) and embedded electronics. Failure to achieve these goals could substantially impact long-term growth.</li>
<li><strong>Likelihood:</strong> Moderate. The company has demonstrated outperformance of the industry and strong order wins, but success in new segments and technologies is not guaranteed.</li>
<li><strong>Trend:</strong> Increasing, The company&rsquo;s vision 2030 plan is to achieve a larger presence in 4-wheeler space and electric vehicles.</li>
<li><strong>Mitigation Strategies:</strong> Diversification of product portfolio (4-wheeler, non-automotive), backward integration for technology components, strategic collaborations, and potential acquisitions.</li>
<li><strong>Control Effectiveness:</strong> Appears moderate to high, based on historical financial performance and strategic initiatives, but needs continuous assessment as the company pursues new ventures.</li>
<li><strong>Potential Financial Impact:</strong> Significant. Failure to execute the 2030 strategy could lead to lower revenue growth and profitability than projected.

<ul>
<li><strong>Challenges:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Exposure to inflation and global uncertainties.</li>
<li>Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates (primarily EURO, USD, CHF, CNY, GBP, SGD and JPY).</li>

  Scenario Analysis and Sensitivity
  <a class="anchor" href="#scenario-analysis-and-sensitivity">#</a>
</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Goodwill Impairment (Maxwell):</strong> Sensitivity analysis performed. Management believes reasonable changes in discount rate, terminal growth rate, or EBITDA margins would not cause the carrying value to exceed its recoverable amount.</li>
<li><strong>Goodwill Impairment (European Business):</strong> Similar sensitivity analysis performed, with the same conclusion.</li>
<li><strong>Interest Rate Sensitivity:</strong> A 100 basis point increase/decrease in interest rates would impact pre-tax profit on debt obligations, with variable rate WCDL/CC balance/ECB. For Example, for year end March 31st, 2024 a 100 basis points increase would reduce profit before tax by H 57.96 million.</li>
<li><strong>Foreign Currency Sensitivity:</strong> A 10% change in USD, EUR, GBP, and CNY exchange rates would have a stated impact on pre-tax equity.</li>
<li><strong>Defined Benefit Obligation Sensitivity:</strong> Sensitivity analysis on gratuity obligations provided, showing the impact of changes in discount rate, salary escalation, and withdrawal rates.</li>

  Key Accounting Policies and Changes

</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Revenue Recognition:</strong> Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of goods or services to the customer, net of GST. Variable consideration (rebates, incentives, discounts) is estimated and constrained.</li>
<li><strong>Leases:</strong> The single recognition and measurement approach is applied for most leases.</li>
<li><strong>Foreign Currency Translation:</strong> Transactions are recorded at exchange rates prevailing on the transaction date. Monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the balance sheet date exchange rate.</li>
<li><strong>Borrowing Costs:</strong> Costs directly attributable to qualifying assets are capitalized.</li>
<li><strong>Government Grants:</strong> Recognized at fair value when receipt and compliance with conditions are reasonably assured.</li>
<li><strong>Employee Benefits:</strong> Defined contribution plans are expensed as incurred. Defined benefit plans are valued using the Projected Unit Credit Method.</li>
<li><strong>Impairment:</strong> Financial assets are assessed using the simplified approach for trade receivables (lifetime expected credit losses). Non-financial assets are assessed for impairment indicators at each reporting date.</li>
<li><strong>Business Combinations:</strong> Accounted for using the acquisition method.</li>
<li><strong>Changes:</strong> Amendments to Ind AS 1 (Disclosure of Accounting Policies) impacted disclosures, but not measurement, recognition, or presentation. Amendments to Ind AS 8 and 12 had no impact.</li>

  Accounting Quality and Regulatory Risk Assessment
  <a class="anchor" href="#accounting-quality-and-regulatory-risk-assessment">#</a>
</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Accounting Quality:</strong> The use of estimates (impairment, defined benefit plans, useful lives) introduces inherent uncertainty. The unmodified audit opinions and disclosure of key audit matters provide some assurance of accounting quality. Reliance on external actuaries and valuation specialists for key estimates enhances reliability.</li>
<li><strong>Regulatory Risk:</strong> Exposure exists related to contingent liabilities from various tax and employee matters. Compliance with SEBI regulations and the Companies Act is stated, with specific disclosures made regarding related party transactions and other statutory information. The unquantified potential impact of contingent liabilities and pending finalization of the Code on Social Security, 2020 introduce areas of regulatory risk.</li>
