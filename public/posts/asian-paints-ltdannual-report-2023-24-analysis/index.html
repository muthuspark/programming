  Scenario Analysis and Sensitivity to Key Assumptions
  <a class="anchor" href="#scenario-analysis-and-sensitivity-to-key-assumptions">#</a>
</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Inflation Impact:</strong> Persistent inflation, particularly in rural markets, has already led to a moderation in revenue growth and downtrading to economy products. Sensitivity analysis around raw material price fluctuations indicates a direct impact on margins. Management notes that correcting raw material prices and internal cost optimization support strong profit growth.</li>
<li><strong>Geopolitical Risk:</strong> Further escalation of conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East could exacerbate supply chain issues and market volatility.</li>
<li><strong>Competitive Landscape:</strong> The widening competitive landscape provides both a challenge (maintaining market share) and an opportunity (industry expansion, benefitting consumers with more choices).</li>
<li><strong>Renewable Energy Targets:</strong> Failure to achieve renewable energy targets could increase operational costs and impact the Company&rsquo;s ESG rating. The current achievement of 65.8% renewable electricity in decorative paint manufacturing suggests a positive trajectory.</li>
<li><strong>Water Neutrality Targets:</strong> Failure to achieve these could expose the Company to operational and reputational risks, especially in water-stressed regions (although currently, none of the Company&rsquo;s sites are in water-stressed areas as per CGWB classification).</li>
<li><strong>Exchange Rate Volatility:</strong> The Company has experienced material impact for example the Egyptian Pound continued to be under pressure and depreciated by close to 53% by the end of FY 2023-24 on the back of an almost 66% depreciation in the previous year.</li>
