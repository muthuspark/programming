I. Financial Performance:
The report reveals a challenging year for ZACL, characterized by a significant decline in profitability compared to the previous year. This is primarily attributed to the sale of the Goa Fertiliser Plant (a discontinued operation) in the previous year, which generated a one-time substantial gain. Excluding this, the continuing operations show a decline, though the overall picture is obscured by the presentation of continuing and discontinued operations together in some financial highlights.">

<p>This analysis covers the key aspects of Zuari Agro Chemicals Limited&rsquo;s (ZACL) Annual Report for the fiscal year 2023-24, focusing on financial performance, business segments, identified risks, and ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) considerations.</p>

</table>
<p><strong>Profitability Ratios (Significant Changes):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Operating Profit Margin:</strong> A dramatic decrease from 19.33% in 2022-23 to 0.83% in 2023-24, highlighting the impact of reduced sales and higher costs.</li>
<li><strong>Net Profit Margin:</strong> Similarly, a significant drop from 187% to 26%, primarily due to the absence of the one-time gain in 2022-23.</li>
<li><strong>Return on Net Worth:</strong> Plunged from 32.71% to 0.11%, indicating severely diminished profitability relative to shareholder equity.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Liquidity and Solvency Ratios:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Current Ratio:</strong> Shows a slight deterioration, indicating potential liquidity concerns.</li>
<li><strong>Debt-Equity Ratio:</strong> Improved slightly, suggesting improved debt management, but still reflects a high level of debt.</li>
</ul>
<p>The report indicates that the significant fluctuations in profitability are due to several external factors and the strategic shift in business focus. A detailed analysis of the individual subsidiaries is necessary for a complete financial picture.</p>
<p><strong>II. Business Segments:</strong></p>
<p>ZACL&rsquo;s primary focus is on the production and marketing of Single Super Phosphate (SSP) fertilizers under the &ldquo;Jai Kisaan&rdquo; brand.  However, the consolidated financials include the performance of its subsidiaries:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mangalore Chemicals &amp; Fertilizers Limited (MCFL):</strong> This subsidiary is engaged in the manufacturing of fertilizers (Nitrogenous and Phosphatic). Its financial performance showed an improvement in 2023-24 compared to the previous year.</li>
<li><strong>Zuari Farmhub Limited (ZFL):</strong> Operates in specialty nutrients, plant protection chemicals, agri-retail (Jai Kisaan Junctions), and analytical/advisory services.  Showed a loss in 2023-24 compared to a profit in the previous year.</li>
<li><strong>Adventz Trading DMCC:</strong> This subsidiary was dissolved during the year, indicating a strategic exit from this business venture.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>III. Risks:</strong></p>
<p>The report acknowledges several key risks:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Government Subsidy Delays:</strong> Delays in receiving fertilizer subsidy payments from the government negatively impacts working capital management.</li>
<li><strong>Raw Material Price Volatility:</strong> Fluctuations in rock phosphate prices (primarily imported) and potential supply chain disruptions due to geopolitical factors (Middle East, Red Sea) pose a significant threat to profitability.</li>
<li><strong>Competition:</strong> The presence of numerous small, unorganized players creates price pressure and challenges in maintaining product quality.</li>
<li><strong>Climate Change:</strong> Drought conditions in key markets (Maharashtra, Karnataka) significantly impacted fertilizer consumption.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>IV. ESG Initiatives:</strong></p>
<p>The report provides limited detail on ESG initiatives.  However, the following points are mentioned:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Environmental:</strong>  The Company&rsquo;s fertilizer plant is described as a &ldquo;Zero Effluent Discharge Plant,&rdquo; signifying a commitment to environmental sustainability.  Tree plantation initiatives are also mentioned.</li>
<li><strong>Social:</strong> The company emphasizes its commitment to safety through training and refresher programs for employees and workers, reporting zero fatal incidents during the year.  Various safety and environmental awareness programs were conducted.</li>
<li><strong>Governance:</strong> The report highlights the functioning of various board committees (Audit, Nomination &amp; Remuneration, Stakeholders&rsquo; Relationship, CSR, Risk Management), indicating efforts toward good corporate governance.  However, specific details on board diversity and other aspects of governance are scarce.</li>
</ul>
<p>The CSR activities section highlights the fact that ZACL did not have a CSR obligation for the financial year 2023-24, because its average net profit was negative, according to Section 135 of the Companies Act, 2013.  This indicates a lack of positive financial performance impacting its ESG endeavors.</p>
<p><strong>V. Overall Assessment:</strong></p>
<p>ZACL&rsquo;s 2023-24 annual report showcases a year of significant challenges.  The company experienced a substantial decline in profitability, heavily influenced by external factors like drought conditions and government policy changes.  While the &ldquo;Zero Effluent Discharge Plant&rdquo; status highlights a positive environmental aspect, the overall ESG reporting needs significant enhancement. The absence of a CSR budget reflects the financial difficulties faced.  The company&rsquo;s dependence on government subsidies and volatile raw material prices leaves it vulnerable.  A more comprehensive risk management strategy and a detailed disclosure of ESG initiatives are needed to strengthen investor confidence.  A more detailed analysis of the subsidiaries&rsquo; individual financial performances would improve the transparency of the report.</p>

<p>The values for Zuari Agro Chemicals Limited&rsquo;s assets, as reported in the Standalone Financial Statements (all figures in INR Lakhs):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Total Assets:</strong>  1,07,457.00 as at 31 March 2024</li>
<li><strong>Current Assets:</strong> 9,491.64 as at 31 March 2024</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Within Current Assets:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cash and Cash Equivalents:</strong> 2,506.88 as at 31 March 2024 (This includes balances with banks on current and deposit accounts, cash on hand, and cheques on hand)</li>
<li><strong>Accounts Receivable (Trade Receivables):</strong> 2,569.05 as at 31 March 2024</li>
<li><strong>Inventory:</strong> 3,074.92 as at 31 March 2024</li>
</ul>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to note that these figures represent the <em>standalone</em> financial statements. The consolidated financial statements, which include subsidiaries and joint ventures, would present significantly larger figures for these items.  The consolidated report needs to be analyzed separately to get a view of the overall group’s asset positions.</p>
<h3 class="heading" id="liability-analysis">
  Liability Analysis
  <a class="anchor" href="#liability-analysis">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Based on the Standalone Financial Statements in Zuari Agro Chemicals Limited&rsquo;s annual report (all figures in INR Lakhs):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Total Liabilities:</strong> 87,163.54 as at 31 March 2024</li>
<li><strong>Current Liabilities:</strong> 73,736.72 as at 31 March 2024</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Within Current Liabilities:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Accounts Payable (Trade Payables):</strong>  14,660.36  as at 31 March 2024 (This includes dues to related parties, micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs), and other creditors).  Note that this amount is the total of all outstanding payables; a breakdown by category is provided in Note 15 of the financial statements.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Long-Term Debt:</strong></p>
<p>The report doesn&rsquo;t provide a single line item for &ldquo;Long-Term Debt.&rdquo;  Instead, it details long-term borrowings and other non-current liabilities separately.  To get the total long-term debt figure, we need to combine these components, which involves careful examination of Note 13 (Non-Current Borrowings).  After reviewing this note, the total long term debt (including lease liabilities) amounts to <strong>INR 13,362.04 + 13,426.82 = INR 26,788.86 Lakhs</strong> as at 31 March 2024. However, note this amount includes current maturities of long-term debt presented as current liabilities.</p>
<p><strong>Important Considerations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Consolidated vs. Standalone:</strong>  These figures are from the <em>standalone</em> financial statements.  The consolidated financial statements, incorporating subsidiaries and joint ventures, would have substantially different and usually larger liability figures.</li>
<li><strong>Lease Liabilities:</strong>  Lease liabilities are included within both current and non-current liabilities. The specific amounts within these classifications are found in Notes 14A and 14B.</li>
<li><strong>Other Liabilities:</strong>  The category &ldquo;Other Liabilities&rdquo; encompasses various items (Note 17) and needs careful review for a complete understanding.  Similarly, &ldquo;Other Financial Liabilities&rdquo; (Note 16) requires detailed analysis for a complete financial picture.</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, extracting precise figures requires a careful review of the detailed notes to the financial statements, particularly Notes 13, 14, 15, and 16.  Always refer to the original annual report for the most accurate and up-to-date information.</p>
<h3 class="heading" id="equity-analysis">
  Equity Analysis
  <a class="anchor" href="#equity-analysis">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Based on Zuari Agro Chemicals Limited&rsquo;s Standalone Statement of Changes in Equity as at 31 March 2024 (all figures in INR Lakhs):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shareholders&rsquo; Equity:</strong> 20,293.46 as at 31 March 2024.  This represents the residual interest in the assets of the company after deducting all its liabilities.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Components of Shareholders&rsquo; Equity:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Share Capital:</strong> 4,205.80  as at 31 March 2024. This reflects the nominal value of the issued and fully paid-up equity shares.  This figure remained unchanged during the year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Retained Earnings:</strong> This is not explicitly stated as a single line item. Instead, it&rsquo;s implicitly included within the &ldquo;Reserves and Surplus&rdquo; component of other equity.  The &ldquo;Reserves and Surplus&rdquo; figure is broken down into several reserves. The actual retained earnings represent the cumulative profits or losses retained within the business, after deducting any dividend distributions. To extract this precisely, you need to analyze the breakdown provided in Note 12 of the annual report. Analyzing Note 12 shows that the <strong>Surplus/(Deficit) in the Statement of Profit and Loss</strong> is (60,930.63).  This is the most direct measure of the <em>current-year&rsquo;s</em> impact on retained earnings.  The previous year&rsquo;s figure was (62,738.76). The complete historical retained earnings are not explicitly disclosed, which is a weakness of the reporting.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Note:</strong> These figures are from the <em>standalone</em> financial statements. The consolidated financial statements, which include subsidiaries and joint ventures, will report different and usually significantly larger values for shareholders&rsquo; equity and its components.</p>

  Operating Performance

</h3>
<p>The following figures are from Zuari Agro Chemicals Limited&rsquo;s Standalone Statement of Profit and Loss for the year ended 31 March 2024 (all amounts in INR Lakhs):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Revenue:</strong> 23,252.97  (This includes both revenue from operations and other income)</li>
<li><strong>Revenue from Operations:</strong> 8,300.26 (This represents the revenue generated from the core business of selling fertilizers)</li>
<li><strong>Cost of Revenue:</strong>  The report doesn&rsquo;t explicitly label a single &ldquo;Cost of Revenue&rdquo; line. However, the closest approximation is the &ldquo;Cost of raw material and components consumed&rdquo; which is 5,609.29.  It&rsquo;s crucial to note this might not be a fully comprehensive cost of revenue figure, as it doesn&rsquo;t include all possible direct costs associated with generating the 8,300.26 Lakhs of operating revenue.</li>
<li><strong>Gross Profit:</strong> To calculate this, we would subtract the cost of revenue from the revenue from operations:  8,300.26 - 5,609.29 = 2,690.97 Lakhs (approximately).  This is an approximation as the full cost of revenue isn&rsquo;t clearly identified in the financial statements.</li>
<li><strong>Operating Expenses:</strong> The report lists several expense categories. To determine the total operating expenses, we need to sum the relevant line items.  This includes:  Cost of raw material and components consumed (5,609.29), Purchases of traded goods (-), Changes in inventories of finished goods, traded goods and work in progress (1,246.90), Employee benefits expense (308.79), Finance costs (10,129.61), Depreciation and amortization expense (324.47), and Other expenses (3,493.86).  The total <em>approximate</em> operating expenses (excluding Finance Costs which are usually considered separately), would then be: 5,609.29 + 1,246.90 + 308.79 + 324.47 + 3,493.86 = <strong>INR 11,000 Lakhs (approximately).</strong>  Again, this is approximate due to the lack of a clear delineation of operating expenses.</li>
<li><strong>Operating Income:</strong> This is calculated by subtracting the operating expenses from the revenue from operations: 8,300.26 - 11,000 = <strong>(2,700 Lakhs approximately).</strong>  Note that this is likely a loss due to the high operating expenses compared to the revenue from operations.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Notes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Standalone vs. Consolidated:</strong> These figures are from the <em>standalone</em> financial statements.  The consolidated results, encompassing subsidiaries and joint ventures, would significantly differ.</li>
<li><strong>Expense Classification:</strong> ZACL&rsquo;s financial statement presentation isn&rsquo;t perfectly clear in differentiating between operating and non-operating expenses.  The calculations above make certain assumptions, and a more precise calculation would need more detailed line-item disclosure.  This lack of clarity in expense categorization is a significant weakness in the financial reporting.</li>
</ul>
<p>Always consult the original financial statements for the most accurate figures. The approximations above are based on an interpretation of the available information and may not be completely precise due to the report&rsquo;s presentation format.</p>
<h3 class="heading" id="bottom-line-metrics">
  Bottom Line Metrics
  <a class="anchor" href="#bottom-line-metrics">#</a>
</h3>
<p>The values for Zuari Agro Chemicals Limited&rsquo;s key profitability metrics, based on the Standalone Statement of Profit and Loss (all figures are in INR Lakhs):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Net Income:</strong> 2,140.05 as at 31 March 2024.  This is the profit after deducting all expenses, including taxes.  It&rsquo;s crucial to note that this figure is for <em>continuing operations only</em>.  The report shows a loss from discontinued operations, which needs to be considered for a complete picture of net income.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>EBITDA:</strong> The report doesn&rsquo;t directly provide an EBITDA figure. EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization) is a key measure of operating profitability. To calculate it, we need to add back depreciation and amortization and interest expenses to the profit before tax figure.   Based on information available:</p>
<ul>
<li>Profit Before Tax (from continuing operations): 2,140.05</li>
<li>Depreciation and Amortization Expense: 324.47</li>
<li>Finance Costs: 10,129.61</li>
<li><strong>Approximated EBITDA:</strong> 2,140.05 + 324.47 - 10,129.61 = <strong>(7,665.09 Lakhs)</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This approximated EBITDA shows a significant loss, suggesting substantial operational inefficiencies. It is important to note that other non-operating income and expenses might need to be included/excluded depending on the specific definition of EBITDA utilized.</p>

<li>
<p><strong>Basic EPS:</strong> 5.09  for continuing operations as at 31 March 2024. This represents the earnings per share based on the weighted average number of outstanding shares.  The figure for discontinued operations is not provided and must be accounted for.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Diluted EPS:</strong> 5.09 for continuing operations as at 31 March 2024.  This is the same as the basic EPS, suggesting there were no dilutive securities that would affect this metric. The figure for discontinued operations is not provided and must be accounted for.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Considerations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Standalone vs. Consolidated:</strong> The above figures are from the <em>standalone</em> financial statements.  Consolidated figures, including subsidiaries and joint ventures, would be significantly higher.</li>
<li><strong>Discontinued Operations:</strong> The standalone results include a <em>loss</em> from discontinued operations (the sale of the Goa fertiliser plant occurred in the prior year).  To get a completely accurate picture of net income for the 2023-24 fiscal year, you&rsquo;d need to account for that loss. The provided EPS values are solely for continuing operations, which doesn&rsquo;t provide a whole picture.  A complete EPS would require that the loss from discontinued operations be factored in.</li>
<li><strong>Approximations:</strong> The EBITDA calculation is an <em>approximation</em> because the exact categorization of operating expenses is not clearly laid out in the provided financial statements.</li>
</ul>
<p>Always refer to the original annual report for precise figures and a complete understanding of the financial performance, particularly regarding discontinued operations.</p>

  Cash Flow Components
  <a class="anchor" href="#cash-flow-components">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Based on Zuari Agro Chemicals Limited&rsquo;s Standalone Statement of Cash Flows for the year ended 31 March 2024 (all figures in INR Lakhs):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Operating Cash Flow:</strong> 337.37. This represents the cash generated from the company&rsquo;s core business activities.  A negative operating cash flow would indicate that the business is not generating sufficient cash from its operations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Investing Cash Flow:</strong> 12,861.63.  This reflects the cash flows related to investments in and disposals of long-term assets. A positive investing cash flow suggests the company has made significant asset sales that may be strategic changes, while a negative number suggests the company is investing in capital improvements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Financing Cash Flow:</strong> (11,614.08). This represents cash flows related to debt financing, equity, and dividend payments. A negative financing cash flow would suggest that the company has repaid debts, paid dividends, or repurchased shares.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Considerations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Standalone vs. Consolidated:</strong> These are the <em>standalone</em> cash flow figures. The consolidated statement of cash flows, incorporating subsidiaries and joint ventures, will show different, typically larger, values for each category.</li>
<li><strong>Reconciliation:</strong>  Always examine the detailed reconciliation of net income to net cash from operating activities. This reconciliation helps to understand how adjustments to the net income figure (e.g., for non-cash expenses like depreciation and changes in working capital) arrive at the operating cash flow amount.</li>
</ul>
<p>For a complete understanding, always refer to the original annual report and carefully examine the notes accompanying the statement of cash flows. The provided numbers only cover continuing operations; a full cash flow statement accounting for discontinued operations must be reviewed.</p>

  Cash Flow Metrics
  <a class="anchor" href="#cash-flow-metrics">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Zuari Agro Chemicals Limited&rsquo;s annual report doesn&rsquo;t directly provide a &ldquo;Free Cash Flow&rdquo; figure.  Free cash flow (FCF) is calculated as operating cash flow less capital expenditures. We need to derive it from the information provided.  Here&rsquo;s what we can determine (all figures in INR Lakhs):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Operating Cash Flow:</strong> 337.37 (from the Standalone Statement of Cash Flows)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Capital Expenditure (CAPEX):</strong> This isn&rsquo;t explicitly stated as a single figure.  However, we can approximate it from the investing activities section of the cash flow statement.  The major investing cash outflow is related to the purchase of property, plant, and equipment, which is (318.56). Therefore, <strong>approximated CAPEX is (318.56)</strong> Lakhs. Other smaller outflows exist within investing activities, but this is the largest and most indicative of CAPEX.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Approximated Free Cash Flow (FCF):</strong>  Using the approximations above: 337.37 - (-318.56) = 655.93 Lakhs. This is positive, suggesting the business is able to generate cash after accounting for capital investments.  However, this is an approximation that relies on the interpretation of various line items and doesn&rsquo;t account for other factors that could influence FCF.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dividends Paid:</strong> The report states that no dividends were paid during the fiscal year 2023-24.  This information is found in the Directors&rsquo; Report and the Notes to the Financial Statements.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Considerations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Standalone vs. Consolidated:</strong>  These calculations are based on the <em>standalone</em> statement of cash flows. The consolidated cash flows would provide a different, and usually larger, picture.</li>
<li><strong>Approximations:</strong> The CAPEX and FCF figures are approximations. A precise FCF calculation requires a more detailed breakdown of all cash inflows and outflows related to capital investments. Other factors, like changes in working capital, may also need to be considered for a complete FCF picture.</li>
<li><strong>Discontinued Operations:</strong> The cash flow figures might not entirely account for the cash flows from the discontinued operations in the prior year.  Reviewing this will refine the calculation.</li>
</ul>
<p>To obtain precise figures, you must refer to the original annual report and use a comprehensive approach to determining Free Cash Flow by accounting for all relevant cash flows.</p>

  Profitability Ratios
  <a class="anchor" href="#profitability-ratios">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Calculating the profitability ratios for Zuari Agro Chemicals Limited requires careful attention to the presentation of the standalone financial statements.  The report does not explicitly separate the financial data of continuing and discontinued operations consistently.  The calculations below will therefore focus primarily on the <em>continuing operations</em> as presented in the <em>standalone</em> financial statements. These will be approximations due to the issues in the presentation of the financial statements.</p>
<p>To calculate these ratios, we need to make certain assumptions and approximations due to the way the financial statements are presented. Using the numbers provided earlier (in INR Lakhs):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Revenue from Operations:</strong> 8,300.26</li>
<li><strong>Cost of Raw Materials and Components Consumed (approximated cost of revenue):</strong> 5,609.29</li>
<li><strong>Profit Before Tax (PBT) from continuing operations:</strong> 2,140.05</li>
<li><strong>Profit After Tax (PAT) from continuing operations:</strong> 2,140.05</li>
<li><strong>Total Assets (Standalone):</strong> 107,457.00</li>
<li><strong>Shareholders&rsquo; Equity (Standalone):</strong> 20,293.46</li>
<li><strong>Total Expenses (approximated operating expenses):</strong>  ~11,000 (Approximation excluding Finance costs)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Approximated Profitability Ratios:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Gross Profit Margin:</strong> (Revenue from Operations - Approximated Cost of Revenue) / Revenue from Operations  = (8,300.26 - 5,609.29) / 8,300.26 = 0.32 or <strong>32%</strong> (approximately). This is the profit margin after accounting for direct costs of producing the goods.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Operating Profit Margin:</strong> (Profit Before Tax + Finance Costs) / Revenue from Operations = (2,140.05 + 10,129.61) / 8,300.26 = 1.47 or <strong>147%</strong> (approximately). Note that this is unusual. It arises because the finance cost is significantly large due to non-operating activities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Net Profit Margin:</strong> Profit After Tax from continuing operations / Revenue from Operations = 2,140.05 / 8,300.26 = 0.26 or <strong>26%</strong> (approximately).  This is the percentage of revenue that translates into profit after all expenses and taxes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Return on Equity (ROE):</strong> Net Income / Average Shareholders&rsquo; Equity. To approximate this, we would need the shareholders&rsquo; equity at the beginning and end of the fiscal year to calculate the average. Since we only have the figure as at 31 March 2024 and the prior year’s, we will approximate average equity as (20,293.46 + 17,006.67) / 2 = 18,650.07.  Then ROE = 2,140.05 / 18,650.07 = 0.11 or <strong>11%</strong> (approximately). This is a measure of how effectively the company is using its shareholder investments to generate profit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Return on Assets (ROA):</strong> Net Income / Average Total Assets.  Similarly, we need the beginning and end of year figures to calculate average total assets for a precise ratio. Using an approximation of (107,457.00 + Prior Year’s Value)/2 to calculate the average, ROA will then be calculated as 2,140.05 / (Average Total Assets) = <strong>%</strong> (calculation cannot be completed without the prior year’s value of total assets). This shows how efficiently the company is employing its assets to generate earnings.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Considerations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Standalone Limitations:</strong> These calculations are based on the <em>standalone</em> financial statements and only consider <em>continuing operations</em>. The results would differ substantially from those of the consolidated financial statements.</li>
<li><strong>Approximations:</strong> The cost of revenue and operating expenses are approximated since the reporting does not distinctly separate them. The ROE is also an approximate calculation due to the lack of beginning of year data for equity.</li>
<li><strong>Discontinued Operations:</strong> The sale of the Goa fertilizer plant significantly impacted the 2022-23 figures. Excluding this, the profitability ratios will provide a more realistic and comparable view.</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, use these figures with caution and always refer to the original report for complete, accurate data.  A clearer separation of continuing and discontinued operations is needed to enable a more precise and reliable analysis of profitability.  Additionally, including beginning-of-year financial data would improve calculation accuracy.</p>

  Liquidity Ratios
  <a class="anchor" href="#liquidity-ratios">#</a>
</h3>
<p>To calculate Zuari Agro Chemicals Limited&rsquo;s liquidity ratios, we&rsquo;ll use the figures from the Standalone Balance Sheet as at 31 March 2024 (all figures in INR Lakhs):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Current Assets:</strong> 9,491.64</li>
<li><strong>Current Liabilities:</strong> 73,736.72</li>
<li><strong>Cash and Cash Equivalents:</strong> 2,506.88</li>
<li><strong>Current Liabilities:</strong> 73,736.72</li>
<li><strong>Accounts Receivable:</strong> 2,569.05</li>
<li><strong>Inventory:</strong> 3,074.92</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Approximated Liquidity Ratios:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Current Ratio:</strong> Current Assets / Current Liabilities = 9,491.64 / 73,736.72 = 0.13.  This indicates that the company&rsquo;s current assets are significantly lower than its current liabilities.  A ratio below 1 suggests potential difficulties in meeting short-term obligations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Quick Ratio (Acid-Test Ratio):</strong> (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities = (9,491.64 - 3,074.92) / 73,736.72 = 0.09. This is a more stringent measure of liquidity, excluding inventories (which might not be readily convertible to cash).  A ratio below 1 further emphasizes the potential liquidity issues.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cash Ratio:</strong> Cash and Cash Equivalents / Current Liabilities = 2,506.88 / 73,736.72 = 0.03. This is the most conservative liquidity ratio, focusing only on the most liquid assets (cash and cash equivalents) relative to current liabilities.  The extremely low ratio further strengthens the indication of potential liquidity problems.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Considerations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Standalone Limitations:</strong> These calculations are based on the <em>standalone</em> balance sheet. The consolidated balance sheet would show substantially different values.</li>
<li><strong>Approximation:</strong> The calculations are precise based on the available data; however, the liquidity ratios should be interpreted in conjunction with other financial metrics.  Qualitative factors also play a role in evaluating liquidity (e.g., access to credit lines).</li>
</ul>
<p>The low liquidity ratios for Zuari Agro Chemicals Limited suggest that the company has a significant challenge in meeting its short-term obligations. This calls for a deeper analysis into the company&rsquo;s cash flow generation, debt management strategies, and access to additional financing options.  Always refer to the original financial statements for the most accurate figures.</p>
<h3 class="heading" id="efficiency-ratios">
  Efficiency Ratios
  <a class="anchor" href="#efficiency-ratios">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Calculating efficiency ratios for Zuari Agro Chemicals Limited requires using data from both the Standalone Statement of Profit and Loss and the Standalone Balance Sheet.  As with other calculations, this will involve approximations due to the format of the provided statements.  The following calculations are based on the <em>standalone</em> financial statements and only consider <em>continuing operations</em>.  Consolidated figures would be significantly different.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll use the following figures (in INR Lakhs) from the standalone reports for continuing operations:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Net Sales (Revenue from Operations):</strong> 8,300.26</li>
<li><strong>Cost of Goods Sold (approximated from Cost of Raw Materials):</strong> 5,609.29</li>
<li><strong>Average Inventory:</strong> (Beginning Inventory + Ending Inventory) / 2.  We only have the ending inventory (3,074.92).  We will therefore be unable to calculate Average Inventory.</li>
<li><strong>Average Accounts Receivable:</strong>  Similar to inventory, we need the beginning-of-year value to calculate the average.  We only have the ending accounts receivable (2,569.05).  Therefore we cannot calculate Average Accounts Receivable.</li>
<li><strong>Total Assets:</strong> 107,457.00 (end of year)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Approximated Efficiency Ratios (with caveats):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Asset Turnover:</strong> Net Sales / Average Total Assets. To calculate this precisely, we&rsquo;d need the total assets at the beginning of the fiscal year as well as the end of the year.  We can only make an approximation of this. If we use an estimated average of total assets, then Asset Turnover = 8,300.26 / (Average Total Assets) = <strong>%</strong> (cannot be completed without the prior year’s figure). This measures how efficiently the company uses its assets to generate sales.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Inventory Turnover:</strong> Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory. This cannot be calculated precisely because we only have the <em>ending</em> inventory figure.  To calculate this accurately, we&rsquo;d need the beginning inventory figure, as well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Receivables Turnover:</strong> Net Credit Sales / Average Accounts Receivable.  This cannot be precisely calculated as we lack the beginning-of-year accounts receivable figure.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Considerations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Data Limitations:</strong> The inability to calculate inventory turnover and receivables turnover accurately is a direct result of insufficient data in the provided standalone financial statements.</li>
<li><strong>Standalone Focus:</strong> The calculations are based solely on the standalone statements.  Consolidated figures are typically different and should be analyzed separately.</li>
<li><strong>Approximation:</strong> The Asset Turnover calculation is approximate.  Without the beginning-of-year total assets, the average asset value calculation cannot be precise.</li>
</ul>
<p>To obtain accurate calculations for these ratios, one must use the full annual report with complete beginning-of-year information for assets, receivables, and inventory.   The incomplete data significantly limits the ability to perform a thorough efficiency analysis.</p>

  Leverage Ratios
  <a class="anchor" href="#leverage-ratios">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Calculating leverage ratios for Zuari Agro Chemicals Limited requires data from both the Standalone Balance Sheet and the Standalone Statement of Profit and Loss.  The calculations below will use data from the <em>standalone</em> financial statements and will involve approximations due to the way the financial statements are presented. Consolidated figures would be different.  We&rsquo;ll use the following figures (in INR Lakhs):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Total Liabilities:</strong> 87,163.54</li>
<li><strong>Shareholders&rsquo; Equity:</strong> 20,293.46</li>
<li><strong>Total Assets:</strong> 107,457.00</li>
<li><strong>Profit Before Tax (PBT):</strong> 2,140.05</li>
<li><strong>Interest Expense:</strong> 10,129.61 (from the standalone Statement of Profit and Loss)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Approximated Leverage Ratios:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Debt-to-Equity Ratio:</strong> Total Liabilities / Shareholders&rsquo; Equity = 87,163.54 / 20,293.46 = 4.29. This shows the proportion of the company&rsquo;s financing that comes from debt relative to equity. A high ratio suggests higher financial risk.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Debt-to-Assets Ratio:</strong> Total Liabilities / Total Assets = 87,163.54 / 107,457.00 = 0.81.  This indicates the proportion of a company&rsquo;s assets that are financed by debt. A high ratio implies greater financial risk.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Interest Coverage Ratio:</strong> Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT) / Interest Expense.  EBIT (Earnings Before Interest and Taxes) is not directly provided. However, we can approximate it. Using the PBT: EBIT is approximately the Profit Before Tax  + Interest Expense = 2,140.05 + 10,129.61 = 12,269.66. Then Interest Coverage Ratio = 12,269.66 / 10,129.61 = 1.21. This ratio shows the company&rsquo;s ability to meet its interest obligations. A ratio below 1 suggests the company might struggle to pay its interest expenses.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Considerations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Standalone Limitations:</strong> These calculations are based on the <em>standalone</em> financial statements. Consolidated figures would differ significantly.</li>
<li><strong>Approximations:</strong> The EBIT and therefore the Interest Coverage Ratio are approximations due to the potential inclusion of non-operating items in the Profit Before Tax figure and the treatment of discontinued operations.</li>
</ul>
<p>These leverage ratios suggest that Zuari Agro Chemicals Limited has a relatively high level of debt compared to its equity and assets. The low interest coverage ratio indicates a potential struggle in meeting its interest obligations. However, it is important to consult the original annual report for more detailed information and to analyze the consolidated figures for a more comprehensive assessment of the company&rsquo;s financial health.</p>

  Market Metrics
  <a class="anchor" href="#market-metrics">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Several of the requested market-based metrics require information not directly provided within the annual report itself.  The annual report provides the financial statements of the company, but market-based metrics require current market data (stock price, number of outstanding shares).  I cannot access real-time information, including live stock prices.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what we <em>can</em> determine from the provided annual report, with explanations of what additional information is needed for the remaining metrics:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Market Cap:</strong> Market Capitalization = Current Market Price per Share * Number of Outstanding Shares. The annual report provides the number of outstanding shares (4,20,58,006).  However, the <em>current market price per share</em> is needed to calculate market cap and is not provided in the report.  This information must be obtained from a financial website providing real-time stock quotes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>P/E Ratio (Price-to-Earnings Ratio):</strong> Market Price per Share / Earnings Per Share (EPS). This requires both the current market price per share (not in the report) and the EPS.  The annual report provides the EPS for continuing operations (5.09 INR).  However, the complete EPS figure that incorporates the loss from discontinued operations is needed for an accurate calculation.   The market price per share is crucial and must be obtained from a live stock quote.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>P/B Ratio (Price-to-Book Ratio):</strong> Market Price per Share / Book Value per Share. This again requires the current market price per share (not provided) and the book value per share (which can be derived from the balance sheet).  The book value per share is Shareholders&rsquo; Equity / Number of Outstanding Shares = 20,293.46 / 42,058,006 = 0.48 Lakhs per share.  However, we need the current market price to complete this ratio.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dividend Yield:</strong> Annual Dividend per Share / Market Price per Share. The annual report indicates <em>no dividends were paid</em> during the fiscal year. Therefore, the dividend yield is 0%.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dividend Payout Ratio:</strong> Total Dividends Paid / Net Income. Since no dividends were paid, the dividend payout ratio is 0%.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In summary:  The annual report provides the foundational financial data (EPS, book value per share, number of outstanding shares, dividends paid). However, to compute the market cap, P/E ratio, and P/B ratio, you <em>must</em> obtain the current market price per share from a reputable financial data source.  Once you have that current market price, these ratios can be calculated.</p>

  Management Assessment
  <a class="anchor" href="#management-assessment">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Zuari Agro Chemicals Limited&rsquo;s management highlights several key strategies, competitive advantages, market conditions, challenges, and opportunities in the Annual Report and Management Discussion and Analysis.  Here&rsquo;s a summary:</p>
<p><strong>I. Key Strategies:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Focus on SSP Fertilizers:</strong>  Concentrating on the manufacturing and marketing of Single Super Phosphate (SSP) fertilizers, leveraging the &ldquo;Jai Kisaan&rdquo; brand in key regions. This indicates a strategy of specialization and targeted market penetration.</li>
<li><strong>Strengthening Distribution Network:</strong> Expanding and improving the distribution network to enhance market reach and customer service. This is a crucial strategy for increasing sales and market presence.</li>
<li><strong>Product Diversification (through subsidiaries):</strong> Expanding into specialty fertilizers, plant protection chemicals, and agri-retail through subsidiaries like Zuari Farmhub Limited. This broadens the revenue streams and reduces reliance on a single product.</li>
<li><strong>Cost Optimization:</strong> Implementing measures to improve operational efficiency and reduce costs in production and distribution. This involves finding ways to use raw materials efficiently.</li>
<li><strong>Government Engagement:</strong> Proactive engagement with government agencies regarding policies impacting the fertilizer sector.  This highlights the crucial role of government subsidies and regulations in the industry and the need to maintain relationships with government bodies.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>II. Competitive Advantages:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Strong Brand Recognition (Jai Kisaan):</strong>  Established brand recognition in certain regions provides a competitive edge.  This brand recognition enables the company to increase prices.</li>
<li><strong>Established Distribution Network:</strong> An existing distribution network provides access to customers and facilitates efficient product delivery.</li>
<li><strong>Manufacturing Expertise:</strong> Experience and expertise in fertilizer manufacturing. This experience will lead to lower production costs compared to other firms.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>III. Market Conditions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fluctuating Demand:</strong>  The SSP market is subject to fluctuations influenced by factors such as weather patterns (drought conditions impacting consumption), economic cycles, and government policies.  This emphasizes the uncertainty inherent in the fertilizer market and the company&rsquo;s sensitivity to changes in agricultural production.</li>
<li><strong>Intense Competition:</strong> The market is highly competitive, with numerous smaller players.  This necessitates a strategy to stand out from competitors, which involves a focus on quality and innovation.</li>
<li><strong>Government Regulations:</strong> The fertilizer industry is heavily regulated and dependent on government subsidies and pricing policies. This highlights the importance of the relationship between the company and the government.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>IV. Challenges:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Drought Conditions:</strong>  Adverse weather patterns leading to reduced fertilizer consumption in key markets, impacting sales revenue and profitability. This highlights the sensitivity of the business to the effects of climate change.</li>
<li><strong>Government Subsidy Delays/Reductions:</strong>  Delays or changes in government subsidy payments affect the company&rsquo;s cash flow and profitability. This points to the vulnerability of the business model to uncertainties regarding government policies.</li>
<li><strong>Raw Material Price Volatility:</strong>  Fluctuating prices and potential supply disruptions of imported raw materials threaten profitability. This is a critical challenge in an industry that relies on global commodity markets.</li>
<li><strong>Competition from Unorganized Sector:</strong> Competition from smaller, less regulated entities puts downward pressure on prices and poses challenges in maintaining quality standards.  This is typical of many agricultural industries.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>V. Opportunities:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>&lsquo;Make in India&rsquo; Initiative:</strong> The government&rsquo;s focus on domestic manufacturing could present opportunities for growth and market expansion. This policy could lead to increased protection for domestic fertilizer producers.</li>
<li><strong>Product Innovation:</strong> Developing and introducing new, high-quality fertilizer products to meet evolving farmer needs and gain a competitive edge. This is an opportunity to distinguish the company from competitors.</li>
<li><strong>Market Expansion:</strong>  Further expanding distribution networks and exploring new markets. This strategy involves increasing market reach, which could lead to higher sales.</li>
<li><strong>Cost Optimization:</strong>  Focusing on operational efficiency improvements can enhance profitability. This will lead to higher profit margins compared to competitors.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Overall:</strong></p>
<p>ZACL&rsquo;s strategy focuses on navigating a challenging market through specialization, diversification (via subsidiaries), and cost control while maintaining close engagement with the government. The company recognizes its vulnerability to external factors (weather, raw material prices, government policies) and aims to mitigate these risks through proactive strategies and careful management. The company has a clearly stated strategy of managing its risks, while it maintains a close working relationship with the government.</p>
<h3 class="heading" id="esg-ratings">
  ESG Ratings
  <a class="anchor" href="#esg-ratings">#</a>
</h3>
<p>The provided annual report for Zuari Agro Chemicals Limited does <em>not</em> include ESG ratings from any external rating agencies.  The report mentions some ESG-related initiatives, but it doesn&rsquo;t provide any scores or ratings from organizations like MSCI, Sustainalytics, Refinitiv, or others that specialize in ESG assessments.  To find ESG ratings, you&rsquo;d need to consult these independent rating agencies directly or search for them on financial data providers.</p>
<h3 class="heading" id="esg-initiatives">
  ESG Initiatives
  <a class="anchor" href="#esg-initiatives">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Zuari Agro Chemicals Limited&rsquo;s annual report offers limited detail on its Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) performance.  While the report mentions certain initiatives, it lacks comprehensive data and specific targets for many key areas.  Here&rsquo;s a summary based on the available information:</p>
<p><strong>I. Environmental Initiatives:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Zero Effluent Discharge Plant:</strong> The report highlights that the company&rsquo;s fertilizer plant is a &ldquo;Zero Effluent Discharge Plant.&rdquo; This is a significant environmental achievement, minimizing water pollution.</li>
<li><strong>Dust Control Measures:</strong> Initiatives to reduce dust generation during operations (e.g., using water spray systems and dumpers instead of wooden trucks). This indicates an effort to mitigate air pollution.</li>
<li><strong>Tree Plantation:</strong>  A plan to plant 150 trees, showing a commitment to improving the surrounding environment. This is a small-scale initiative to offset environmental impact.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>II. Carbon Footprint:</strong></p>
<p>The annual report does <em>not</em> provide a quantitative measurement of the company&rsquo;s carbon footprint (e.g., greenhouse gas emissions). This is a significant omission in a modern ESG disclosure.</p>
<p><strong>III. Social Initiatives:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Safety Training:</strong> The company conducts safety training and refresher programs for employees and workers, aiming to maintain a safe working environment.  Zero fatal incidents reported demonstrates progress.</li>
<li><strong>Employee Welfare:</strong> The report mentions various activities carried out during National Safety Week, National Road Safety Month, World Environment Day, and other occasions, suggesting a focus on employee well-being and community engagement.  However, specific details are absent.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>IV. Governance Practices:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Board Committees:</strong> The report outlines the existence and functioning of several board committees (Audit, Nomination &amp; Remuneration, Stakeholders&rsquo; Relationship, CSR, Risk Management).  This structure suggests a commitment to good corporate governance.  However, details regarding board diversity, independent director appointments, and committee effectiveness are not provided.</li>
<li><strong>Code of Conduct:</strong> The company has adopted a code of conduct for its directors and senior executives. This is a standard corporate governance practice.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>V. Sustainability Goals:</strong></p>
<p>The annual report does <em>not</em> explicitly define any specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) sustainability goals.  This is a major weakness in the ESG disclosure, particularly in comparison to modern best practices.  The company mentions initiatives but lacks specific targets and timelines to measure progress toward its environmental or social ambitions.</p>
<p><strong>Overall Assessment:</strong></p>
<p>Zuari Agro Chemicals Limited&rsquo;s ESG reporting is inadequate.  While certain positive environmental initiatives are mentioned (zero effluent discharge, dust control), crucial information (carbon footprint, specific sustainability targets) is absent. Social initiatives are mentioned generally, but lack specific details. Governance practices are described but are superficial, without detailed information regarding board composition, independence, and diversity. The report should be significantly improved to include more detailed and specific information about their ESG performance.  This would improve the company&rsquo;s ESG score.</p>

  Operational Metrics
  <a class="anchor" href="#operational-metrics">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Based on Zuari Agro Chemicals Limited&rsquo;s standalone financial statements:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>R&amp;D Expenditure:</strong> The annual report states that no expenditure was incurred on Research and Development during the fiscal year 2023-24. This information is included within the Board&rsquo;s Report.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Employee Count:</strong> The Management Discussion and Analysis section of the report indicates that the company had 34 employees as of 31 March 2024.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to note that this data only represents the Parent Company, Zuari Agro Chemicals Limited.  The consolidated employee count, including subsidiaries, would be considerably higher.  The report does not provide a consolidated employee count.  Furthermore, the lack of R&amp;D spending could be a concern for long-term competitiveness and innovation in the agricultural sector.</p>
<h3 class="heading" id="key-events">
  Key Events
  <a class="anchor" href="#key-events">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Zuari Agro Chemicals Limited&rsquo;s annual report highlights several significant events during the fiscal year 2023-24.  These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Dissolution of Adventz Trading DMCC:</strong>  This wholly-owned subsidiary was dissolved during the year, reflecting a strategic decision to exit that business venture. This suggests a strategic move to streamline operations and focus on core competencies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Capital Reduction of Zuari Farmhub Limited:</strong>  Zuari Farmhub Limited (a subsidiary) underwent a capital reduction approved by the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT).  This was a significant corporate restructuring event. This likely involved writing down losses and reducing the equity of the subsidiary.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Proposed Share Transfer of MCFL Shares:</strong> The parent company proposed the transfer of a significant number of its equity shares in Mangalore Chemicals &amp; Fertilizers Limited (MCFL) to Zuari Maroc Phosphates Private Limited.  This transaction, subject to shareholder approval, was a major related-party transaction. The implementation of this scheme will lead to a major change in the subsidiary.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Issue of Non-Convertible Debentures (NCDs):</strong>  The company issued Non-Convertible Debentures (NCDs) to raise capital. This is a crucial event, influencing its financial position and debt structure. The debentures were issued at an interest rate of 11.65% p.a.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Regional Director Inspection:</strong> The Western Regional Director of the Ministry of Corporate Affairs initiated an inspection of the company under Section 206(5) of the Companies Act, 2013. This suggests a regulatory scrutiny that could impact the company&rsquo;s future operations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Sale of Land Parcels:</strong> The company completed the sale of land parcels at Sancoale, Goa and a land parcel in Pune.  These transactions directly impacted the company&rsquo;s asset base.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These events underscore a year of significant corporate restructuring, capital raising, and regulatory scrutiny at Zuari Agro Chemicals Limited.  These events have all impacted the company&rsquo;s financial statements in varying degrees.</p>
<h3 class="heading" id="audit-information">
  Audit Information
  <a class="anchor" href="#audit-information">#</a>
</h3>
<p><strong>I. Auditor&rsquo;s Opinion:</strong></p>
<p>The independent auditor, K.P. Rao &amp; Co., Chartered Accountants, issued an unqualified (clean) opinion on both the standalone and consolidated financial statements of Zuari Agro Chemicals Limited. This means the auditors found the financial statements to be fairly presented in accordance with Indian Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (IGAAP) and applicable Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS).  The auditors did highlight certain key audit matters which are detailed in their report.</p>
<p><strong>II. Key Accounting Policies:</strong></p>
<p>The annual report details numerous accounting policies, complying with Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) and the Companies Act, 2013.  Here are some of the most significant ones:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Basis of Preparation:</strong> The financial statements are prepared using the historical cost convention, except for certain assets and liabilities measured at fair value (e.g., financial instruments, defined benefit plans).  The statements use the Indian Rupee (INR) as the functional and reporting currency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Revenue Recognition:</strong> Revenue from contracts with customers is recognised when control of goods or services is transferred to the customer.  This includes consideration of variable considerations (e.g., sales returns, volume rebates), significant financing components, and any other significant accounting estimations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Property, Plant, and Equipment (PPE):</strong> PPE is initially recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the asset&rsquo;s estimated useful life.  The useful lives and methods are reviewed annually.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Intangible Assets:</strong>  Intangible assets are measured initially at cost and amortised over their estimated useful lives (if finite).  Impairment testing is performed annually or when there are indications of impairment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Financial Instruments:</strong> Accounting for financial instruments follows Ind AS 109,  with classification depending on the business model and cash flow characteristics.  Impairment is assessed using expected credit loss (ECL) models.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Leases:</strong> The company applies Ind AS 116,  recognising lease liabilities and right-of-use assets for all leases (except for short-term and low-value asset leases).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Government Grants and Subsidies:</strong>  Recognised when there is reasonable assurance of receipt and compliance with conditions.  These are recognised as income over the periods necessary to match the costs, which it is intended to compensate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Inventories:</strong> Valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.  Cost is determined using the moving weighted average method for raw materials, finished goods, and work-in-progress.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Borrowing Costs:</strong>  Costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction, or production of an asset are capitalised; otherwise, they are expensed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Taxes:</strong> The company uses the liability method for deferred taxes.  The tax rates used are those that are enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Employee Benefits:</strong>  Retirement and other employee benefits are recognised in accordance with Ind AS 19,  using the projected unit credit method for defined benefit plans.  Actuarial valuations are conducted annually.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These are just some of the key accounting policies.  The complete list is provided in the annual report&rsquo;s notes to the financial statements, which provide more detailed information and explanations.  The accounting policies section of the report, however, should be further expanded upon.  A more detailed and concise overview of the accounting policies should be included in the report to help investors understand the methods used in accounting for the company&rsquo;s financial statements.</p>
