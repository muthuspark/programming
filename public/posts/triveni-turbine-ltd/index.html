<p>This analysis examines Triveni Turbine Limited&rsquo;s (TTL) annual report for FY2023-24, covering financial performance, business segments, risk management, and ESG initiatives.</p>
<p><strong>I. Financial Performance:</strong></p>
<p>TTL reported record-breaking performance for the third consecutive year.  Key highlights include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Revenue from Operations:</strong>  Increased by 33% to ₹16.54 billion (consolidated) and 27.3% to ₹13.79 billion (standalone).  This growth is attributed to strong performance across product, aftermarket, and export segments.  Exports accounted for 46% of consolidated revenue.</li>
<li><strong>EBITDA:</strong> Grew by 38% to ₹3.81 billion (consolidated) and 42.3% to ₹3.06 billion (standalone), with margins improving to 23% (consolidated) and 22.2% (standalone).</li>

<li><strong>Order Booking:</strong> Reached a record high of ₹18.78 billion (consolidated), a 17% increase year-on-year.  Export orders grew by 51%.  Aftermarket orders showed a significant increase of 34%, surpassing ₹6 billion.</li>

<li><strong>Dividend Payout:</strong>  A total dividend of ₹3.60 per share (360% of face value) was declared, including interim and special dividends, representing a 43% payout of consolidated profit.</li>
<li><strong>Working Capital:</strong> Maintained a negative working capital position of ₹1.95 billion, indicating efficient working capital management.  Asset turnover improved significantly.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key Financial Ratios (Consolidated):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>ROE:</strong> 31.33% (FY24), 23.83% (FY23) - Significant improvement.</li>
<li><strong>Operating Margin (EBITDA/Sales):</strong> 23.04% (FY24), 22.16% (FY23) - Slight improvement.</li>
<li><strong>Net Profit Margin (PAT/Sales):</strong> 16.29% (FY24), 15.46% (FY23) - Improvement.</li>

<li><strong>Current Ratio:</strong> 1.99x (FY24), 1.86x (FY23) - Improvement.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>II. Business Segments:</strong></p>
<p>TTL operates primarily in the industrial steam turbine market, with a focus on the &lt;100 MW segment. Its two main segments are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Product Business:</strong> Manufacturing and supplying industrial steam turbines for various industries (sugar, distillery, cement, steel, food processing, etc.), including API-compliant turbines for the oil and gas sector.  Significant growth was driven by renewable energy applications (Biomass, Waste-to-Energy, Waste Heat Recovery) and API turbines, especially in international markets.</li>
<li><strong>Aftermarket Business (Triveni REFURB):</strong> Provides detailed aftermarket services, including spare parts, maintenance, repairs, and refurbishment of steam turbines of various brands.  This segment experienced exceptional growth, exceeding ₹6 billion in order bookings, driven by refurbishment projects and repeat orders.  The report highlights the company&rsquo;s ability to handle complex refurbishment work and improve turbine efficiency.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>III. Risks:</strong></p>
<p>The annual report identifies many key risks:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Geopolitical Risks:</strong> International conflicts impacting market access and supply chains.</li>
<li><strong>Supply Chain Risks:</strong> Maintaining sufficient capacity to meet growing demand for products and aftermarket services.</li>
<li><strong>Regulatory Compliance:</strong> Increasing complexity of international regulations.</li>
<li><strong>Product Development:</strong> Developing and commercializing new energy-efficient products to maintain a competitive advantage.</li>
<li><strong>ESG-related Risks:</strong> The report highlights potential ESG risks in managing its impact on the environment and its value chain, especially on environmental and social issues.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>IV. ESG Initiatives:</strong></p>
<p>TTL demonstrates a commitment to ESG through various initiatives:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Environmental:</strong>  Focus on energy conservation (12% reduction in energy consumption per rupee of turnover), reduction of emissions (SOx and NOx), and GHG emissions reduction (8% reduction per rupee of turnover).  Implementation of a ZLD system in manufacturing plants and rooftop solar power installations are also emphasized.</li>
<li><strong>Social:</strong>  Strong focus on employee welfare (safety, health initiatives, training programs), talent acquisition and development, and community engagement (education, healthcare, technology development initiatives).  The company highlights its efforts to build a various and inclusive workplace.</li>
<li><strong>Governance:</strong>  Robust corporate governance framework with an independent board, clear roles and responsibilities, and a vigil mechanism in place.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>V. Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>Triveni Turbine Limited demonstrated strong financial performance and growth in FY2023-24, driven by its core competencies in industrial steam turbines and a rapidly expanding aftermarket business. The company&rsquo;s focus on international expansion, renewable energy solutions, and customer-centric aftermarket services positions it well for future growth. However, it needs to actively manage risks associated with geopolitical uncertainty, supply chain challenges, and regulatory compliance.  The company&rsquo;s commitment to ESG initiatives is evident, although the report could provide more quantitative data and targets for future performance in this area.  The report highlights the importance of employee training and development, which is essential for long-term sustainability and competitive advantage in a highly technical industry.</p>

  Asset Analysis

</h3>
<p>The values for total assets, current assets, cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable (trade receivables), and inventory are presented separately for the standalone and consolidated financial statements.  Here&rsquo;s a breakdown of the figures from the provided annual report:</p>
<p><strong>Standalone Financial Statements (as of March 31, 2024):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Total Assets:</strong> ₹13,917.55 million</li>
<li><strong>Current Assets:</strong> ₹10,530.19 million</li>
<li><strong>Cash and Cash Equivalents:</strong> ₹53.92 million</li>
<li><strong>Accounts Receivable (Trade Receivables):</strong> ₹1,250.03 million</li>
<li><strong>Inventory:</strong> ₹2,216.68 million</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Consolidated Financial Statements (as of March 31, 2024):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Total Assets:</strong> ₹16,536.64 million</li>
<li><strong>Current Assets:</strong> ₹13,316.18 million</li>
<li><strong>Cash and Cash Equivalents:</strong> ₹291.16 million</li>
<li><strong>Accounts Receivable (Trade Receivables):</strong> ₹1,780.95 million</li>
<li><strong>Inventory:</strong> ₹2,262.77 million</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember that these figures are reported in Indian Rupees (₹).  The differences between standalone and consolidated figures reflect the inclusion of subsidiary and joint venture financial data in the consolidated statements.</p>
<h3 class="heading" id="liability-analysis">
  Liability Analysis
  <a class="anchor" href="#liability-analysis">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Similar to the assets, the liability figures are also presented separately for standalone and consolidated financial statements.  Here&rsquo;s a breakdown from the annual report:</p>
<p><strong>Standalone Financial Statements (as of March 31, 2024):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Total Liabilities:</strong> ₹6,271.73 million</li>
<li><strong>Current Liabilities:</strong> ₹6,070.87 million</li>
<li><strong>Long-Term Debt:</strong> This isn&rsquo;t explicitly stated as a single line item.  However,  long-term lease liabilities are ₹24.07 million, and deferred tax liabilities are ₹79.53 million.  There are also provisions totaling ₹97.26 million which contain long-term elements, but precise allocation isn&rsquo;t detailed.</li>
<li><strong>Accounts Payable (Trade Payables):</strong> ₹1,591.80 million (This combines amounts owed to micro, small, and other enterprises.)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Consolidated Financial Statements (as of March 31, 2024):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Total Liabilities:</strong> ₹6,923.44 million</li>
<li><strong>Current Liabilities:</strong> ₹6,686.33 million</li>
<li><strong>Long-Term Debt:</strong>  Similar to the standalone statement, long-term debt isn&rsquo;t a single, clearly defined line item. Long-term lease liabilities are ₹24.07 million, and deferred tax liabilities are ₹88.54 million.  Long-term elements within provisions (₹124.50 million) also exist but the breakdown is not provided.</li>
<li><strong>Accounts Payable (Trade Payables):</strong> ₹1,745.57 million (This combines amounts owed to micro, small, and other enterprises).</li>
</ul>
<p>It&rsquo;s essential to note that &ldquo;long-term debt&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t explicitly presented as a single line item in either the standalone or consolidated statements. The figures provided for lease liabilities and deferred tax liabilities represent significant components of long-term obligations, but other potential long-term liabilities might be embedded within other line items, like provisions.  Therefore, a precise figure for long-term debt would require further analysis not possible with the provided information alone.  All figures are in Indian Rupees (₹).</p>
<h3 class="heading" id="equity-analysis">
  Equity Analysis
  <a class="anchor" href="#equity-analysis">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Shareholders&rsquo; equity, retained earnings, and share capital values are also presented differently in the standalone and consolidated financial statements.  Here&rsquo;s the data from the annual report:</p>
<p><strong>Standalone Financial Statements (as of March 31, 2024):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shareholders&rsquo; Equity:</strong> ₹7,645.82 million</li>
<li><strong>Retained Earnings:</strong> ₹7,278.27 million</li>
<li><strong>Share Capital:</strong> ₹317.87 million</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Consolidated Financial Statements (as of March 31, 2024):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shareholders&rsquo; Equity:</strong> ₹9,613.20 million (This includes the parent company&rsquo;s equity and the non-controlling interest)</li>
<li><strong>Retained Earnings:</strong> ₹9,001.79 million (This is the retained earnings attributable to the parent company&rsquo;s equity holders.  The consolidated statement shows a breakdown of equity further.)</li>
<li><strong>Share Capital:</strong> ₹317.87 million (This remains consistent between standalone and consolidated statements because share capital is specific to the parent company.)</li>
</ul>
<p>All figures are in Indian Rupees (₹). The difference between the standalone and consolidated shareholders&rsquo; equity stems from the inclusion of the non-controlling interests in the subsidiaries in the consolidated figures.  The consolidated statement also breaks down other equity into many components, including capital redemption reserve, share-based payment reserve, cash flow hedging reserve, and foreign currency translation reserve.</p>

</h3>
<p>Again, we need to differentiate between the standalone and consolidated financial statements. Here&rsquo;s the data from the annual report:</p>
<p><strong>Standalone Financial Statements (for the year ended March 31, 2024):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Revenue:</strong> ₹14,343.98 million (This includes revenue from operations and other income)</li>
<li><strong>Revenue from Operations:</strong> ₹13,785.70 million</li>
<li><strong>Cost of Revenue:</strong> ₹11,506.72 million (This includes cost of materials consumed, changes in inventories, employee benefits, finance costs, depreciation, impairment losses, and other expenses.)  Note that some expense items, like finance costs, aren&rsquo;t strictly part of &ldquo;cost of goods sold&rdquo; in a traditional sense but are included here as presented in the statement of profit and loss.</li>
<li><strong>Gross Profit:</strong>  ₹2,277.18 million (Revenue from Operations - Cost of Materials Consumed + Changes in Inventories of Finished Goods)</li>
<li><strong>Operating Expenses:</strong> ₹9,270.08 million (This isn&rsquo;t explicitly stated as a single line item.  Instead, it is derived by deducting the cost of materials consumed and changes in inventories from total expenses).</li>
<li><strong>Operating Income (EBITDA):</strong> ₹3,062.0 million.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Consolidated Financial Statements (for the year ended March 31, 2024):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Revenue:</strong> ₹17,161.67 million (Revenue from operations + Other Income)</li>
<li><strong>Revenue from Operations:</strong> ₹16,539.40 million</li>
<li><strong>Cost of Revenue:</strong> ₹13,585.55 million (Similar to the standalone statement, this includes many expense items beyond direct production costs as presented in the statement.)</li>
<li><strong>Gross Profit:</strong> ₹2,953.85 million (Revenue from operations - Cost of materials consumed + Changes in inventories of finished goods and work-in-progress)</li>
<li><strong>Operating Expenses:</strong> ₹10,346.69 million (Derived by subtracting Cost of Materials Consumed and changes in inventory from Total Expenses).</li>
<li><strong>Operating Income (EBITDA):</strong> ₹3,810.2 million.</li>
</ul>
<p>All figures are in Indian Rupees (₹). The discrepancies between the standalone and consolidated figures are due to the inclusion of subsidiary and joint venture financial information in the consolidated statements.  Remember that the definitions of &ldquo;cost of revenue&rdquo; and &ldquo;operating expenses&rdquo; are based on how these items are presented in the company&rsquo;s financial statements; the categorization may differ slightly from other reporting standards.</p>
<h3 class="heading" id="bottom-line-metrics">
  Bottom Line Metrics
  <a class="anchor" href="#bottom-line-metrics">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a summary of Net Income (Profit After Tax - PAT), EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization), Basic Earnings Per Share (Basic EPS), and Diluted Earnings Per Share (Diluted EPS) from Triveni Turbine Limited&rsquo;s annual report, again differentiating between standalone and consolidated figures:</p>
<p><strong>Standalone Financial Statements (for the year ended March 31, 2024):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Net Income (PAT):</strong> ₹2,090.45 million</li>
<li><strong>EBITDA:</strong> ₹3,062.0 million</li>
<li><strong>Basic EPS:</strong> ₹6.58</li>
<li><strong>Diluted EPS:</strong> ₹6.58</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Consolidated Financial Statements (for the year ended March 31, 2024):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Net Income (PAT):</strong> ₹2,694.87 million</li>
<li><strong>EBITDA:</strong> ₹3,810.2 million</li>
<li><strong>Basic EPS:</strong> ₹8.47</li>
<li><strong>Diluted EPS:</strong> ₹8.47</li>
</ul>
<p>All values are reported in Indian Rupees (₹) except for EPS, which is per share.  The differences between standalone and consolidated results are due to the inclusion of subsidiary and joint venture financial data in the consolidated figures.  Note that in this report, basic and diluted EPS are identical.</p>

<p>The cash flow information is also presented separately for standalone and consolidated statements.  Here&rsquo;s the data from Triveni Turbine Limited&rsquo;s annual report:</p>
<p><strong>Standalone Statement of Cash Flows (for the year ended March 31, 2024):</strong></p>
<ul>

  Cash Flow Metrics
  <a class="anchor" href="#cash-flow-metrics">#</a>
</h3>
<p>The annual report doesn&rsquo;t explicitly state &ldquo;free cash flow&rdquo; as a single calculated metric.  However, we can approximate it using the information provided.  Free cash flow is generally calculated as operating cash flow less capital expenditures.  We also have direct figures for dividends.  Here&rsquo;s what we can determine:</p>
<p><strong>Standalone Financial Statements (for the year ended March 31, 2024):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Operating Cash Flow:</strong> ₹2,338.05 million</li>
<li><strong>Capital Expenditure (Purchase of Property, Plant, and Equipment):</strong> ₹287.77 million  (Note: Proceeds from the sale of PPE are not subtracted here to match the typical free cash flow calculation).</li>
<li><strong>Dividends Paid:</strong> ₹731.1 million</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Consolidated Financial Statements (for the year ended March 31, 2024):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Operating Cash Flow:</strong> ₹2,710.05 million</li>
<li><strong>Capital Expenditure (Purchase of Property, Plant, and Equipment):</strong> ₹316.85 million (Again, proceeds from sale aren&rsquo;t subtracted).</li>
<li><strong>Dividends Paid:</strong> ₹731.12 million</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Approximated Free Cash Flow:</strong></p>
<p>To approximate free cash flow, we subtract capital expenditures from operating cash flow:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Standalone:</strong> ₹2,338.05 million - ₹287.77 million = ₹2,050.28 million (approximate)</li>
<li><strong>Consolidated:</strong> ₹2,710.05 million - ₹316.85 million = ₹2,393.20 million (approximate)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Considerations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Accuracy:</strong> This is an <em>approximation</em> of free cash flow.  A precise calculation might include other items, such as changes in working capital, that aren&rsquo;t explicitly separated in the provided cash flow statements.</li>
<li><strong>Definition:</strong> The definition of capital expenditure used here is based on the items shown under &lsquo;Cash flows from investing activities&rsquo;.  A more inclusive definition might include other investments.</li>
<li><strong>Currency:</strong> All values are in Indian Rupees (₹).</li>
</ul>
<p>The report shows a significant amount paid for share buybacks in the previous fiscal year, which would be a cash outflow under financing activities, but is not directly shown in the current year&rsquo;s statement.  If included, it would further reduce the calculated free cash flow.</p>

  Profitability Ratios
  <a class="anchor" href="#profitability-ratios">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Profitability ratios can be calculated using the figures from both the standalone and consolidated financial statements.  Here&rsquo;s a calculation of the key profitability ratios for Triveni Turbine Limited for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024.  Note that some slight variations might arise depending on the precise figures used and rounding.</p>
<p><strong>Standalone Financial Statements:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Gross Profit Margin:</strong> (Gross Profit / Revenue from Operations) * 100 = (₹2,277.18 million / ₹13,785.70 million) * 100 = <strong>16.52%</strong></li>
<li><strong>Operating Profit Margin (EBITDA Margin):</strong> (EBITDA / Revenue from Operations) * 100 = (₹3,062.0 million / ₹13,785.70 million) * 100 = <strong>22.21%</strong></li>
<li><strong>Net Profit Margin:</strong> (Net Income / Revenue) * 100 = (₹2,090.45 million / ₹14,343.98 million) * 100 = <strong>14.58%</strong></li>
<li><strong>Return on Equity (ROE):</strong> (Net Income / Average Shareholders&rsquo; Equity) * 100 = (₹2,090.45 million / [(₹6,249.23 million + ₹7,645.82 million)/2]) * 100 = <strong>20.58%</strong>  (Note: Average equity is calculated by averaging the beginning and ending balances.)</li>
<li><strong>Return on Assets (ROA):</strong> (Net Income / Average Total Assets) * 100 = (₹2,090.45 million / [(₹11,489.23 million + ₹13,917.55 million)/2]) * 100 = <strong>15.16%</strong> (Note: Average total assets are calculated by averaging the beginning and ending balances.)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Consolidated Financial Statements:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Gross Profit Margin:</strong> (Gross Profit / Revenue from Operations) * 100 = (₹2,953.85 million / ₹16,539.40 million) * 100 = <strong>17.85%</strong></li>
<li><strong>Operating Profit Margin (EBITDA Margin):</strong> (EBITDA / Revenue from Operations) * 100 = (₹3,810.2 million / ₹16,539.40 million) * 100 = <strong>23.04%</strong></li>
<li><strong>Net Profit Margin:</strong> (Net Income / Revenue) * 100 = (₹2,694.87 million / ₹17,161.67 million) * 100 = <strong>15.71%</strong></li>
<li><strong>Return on Equity (ROE):</strong> (Net Income / Average Shareholders&rsquo; Equity) * 100 = (₹2,694.87 million / [(₹7,584.50 million + ₹11,294.98 million)/2]) * 100 = <strong>22.67%</strong> (Note: Average equity calculated from parent company equity and non-controlling interest.)</li>
<li><strong>Return on Assets (ROA):</strong> (Net Income / Average Total Assets) * 100 = (₹2,694.87 million / [(₹13,398.82 million + ₹16,536.64 million)/2]) * 100 = <strong>15.29%</strong> (Note: Average total assets are calculated by averaging the beginning and ending balances.)</li>
</ul>
<p>All percentages are approximate, and may differ slightly based on the level of precision used in calculations.  The consolidated figures reflect the performance of the entire group, including subsidiaries and joint ventures, while the standalone figures represent the parent company&rsquo;s performance only.</p>
<h3 class="heading" id="liquidity-ratios">
  Liquidity Ratios
  <a class="anchor" href="#liquidity-ratios">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Liquidity ratios assess a company&rsquo;s ability to meet its short-term obligations.  Here&rsquo;s a calculation of the key liquidity ratios for Triveni Turbine Limited for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024, using data from both the standalone and consolidated financial statements.  Remember that slight variations might occur depending on the rounding used in calculations.</p>
<p><strong>Standalone Financial Statements (as of March 31, 2024):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Current Ratio:</strong> (Current Assets / Current Liabilities) = ₹10,530.19 million / ₹6,070.87 million = <strong>1.73</strong></li>
<li><strong>Quick Ratio:</strong> ((Current Assets - Inventories) / Current Liabilities) = (₹10,530.19 million - ₹2,216.68 million) / ₹6,070.87 million = <strong>1.37</strong></li>
<li><strong>Cash Ratio:</strong> (Cash and Cash Equivalents / Current Liabilities) = ₹53.92 million / ₹6,070.87 million = <strong>0.0089</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Consolidated Financial Statements (as of March 31, 2024):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Current Ratio:</strong> (Current Assets / Current Liabilities) = ₹13,316.18 million / ₹6,686.33 million = <strong>1.99</strong></li>
<li><strong>Quick Ratio:</strong> ((Current Assets - Inventories) / Current Liabilities) = (₹13,316.18 million - ₹2,262.77 million) / ₹6,686.33 million = <strong>1.66</strong></li>
<li><strong>Cash Ratio:</strong> (Cash and Cash Equivalents / Current Liabilities) = ₹291.16 million / ₹6,686.33 million = <strong>0.0436</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>All ratio values are approximate. The consolidated ratios reflect the liquidity position of the entire group, while the standalone ratios reflect only the parent company&rsquo;s liquidity.  The differences stem from the inclusion of subsidiary and joint venture data in the consolidated statements.  Note that the cash ratio is especially low in both cases, indicating that a significant portion of current liabilities are not covered by readily available cash.</p>
<h3 class="heading" id="efficiency-ratios">
  Efficiency Ratios
  <a class="anchor" href="#efficiency-ratios">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Efficiency ratios measure how effectively a company uses its assets to generate sales.  Here&rsquo;s a calculation of key efficiency ratios for Triveni Turbine Limited for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024, using data from both the standalone and consolidated financial statements.  Note that there will be slight variations depending on how averages are calculated and rounding.</p>
<p>To calculate these ratios accurately, we need the beginning-of-year balances for assets and liabilities.  The provided annual report doesn&rsquo;t explicitly state these opening balances for every item, making some calculations less precise than ideal.  We will use the reported average balances where possible.  In some instances, slight variations are possible depending on the method of calculating the average (simple average vs. weighted average).</p>
<p><strong>Standalone Financial Statements:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Asset Turnover:</strong> (Revenue / Average Total Assets) =  ₹14,343.98 million / [(₹11,489.23 million + ₹13,917.55 million) / 2] = <strong>1.03</strong></li>
<li><strong>Inventory Turnover:</strong> (Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory) = ₹9,640.7 million / [(₹1,967.79 million + ₹2,216.68 million) / 2] = <strong>4.82</strong></li>
<li><strong>Receivables Turnover:</strong> (Revenue / Average Accounts Receivable) = ₹14,343.98 million / [(₹978.77 million + ₹1,250.03 million) / 2] = <strong>11.40</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Consolidated Financial Statements:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Asset Turnover:</strong> (Revenue / Average Total Assets) = ₹17,161.67 million / [(₹13,398.82 million + ₹16,536.64 million) / 2] = <strong>1.03</strong></li>
<li><strong>Inventory Turnover:</strong> (Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory) = ₹9,640.7 million / [(₹2,000.32 million + ₹2,262.77 million) / 2] = <strong>4.64</strong></li>
<li><strong>Receivables Turnover:</strong> (Revenue / Average Accounts Receivable) = ₹17,161.67 million / [(₹1,292.80 million + ₹1,780.95 million) / 2] = <strong>10.76</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>All ratio values are approximate.  The differences between standalone and consolidated ratios are attributable to the inclusion of subsidiary and joint venture data in the consolidated figures.  The calculations above use simple averages; using weighted averages may produce slightly different results.  The relatively high inventory turnover ratio suggests that the company is managing its inventory effectively, while a high receivables turnover indicates that it is collecting payments promptly from its customers.  Note that the annual report provides other turnover ratios using different denominators (e.g. debtors turnover ratio).</p>
<h3 class="heading" id="leverage-ratios">
  Leverage Ratios
  <a class="anchor" href="#leverage-ratios">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Leverage ratios show how much debt a company uses to finance its assets.  Calculating these ratios for Triveni Turbine Limited requires careful consideration of what constitutes &ldquo;debt&rdquo; in the context of the provided financial statements. The company has very low levels of traditional debt.  Here&rsquo;s a calculation of the key use ratios for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024, using data from both the standalone and consolidated financial statements. Keep in mind that approximations might arise due to the limited explicit detail on specific debt components provided in the financial statements.</p>
<p><strong>Standalone Financial Statements (as of March 31, 2024):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Debt-to-Equity Ratio:</strong> (Total Debt / Shareholders&rsquo; Equity) =  ₹200.86 million / ₹7,645.82 million = <strong>0.026</strong>  (Note:  Long-term debt is approximated here using the sum of long-term lease liabilities and deferred tax liabilities. Other long-term elements within provisions are not included.)</li>
<li><strong>Debt-to-Assets Ratio:</strong> (Total Debt / Total Assets) = ₹200.86 million / ₹13,917.55 million = <strong>0.014</strong> (Using the same approximation for long-term debt as above.)</li>
<li><strong>Interest Coverage Ratio:</strong> (Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT) / Interest Expense) = ₹2,861.79 million / ₹25.47 million = <strong>112.16</strong> (EBIT is calculated by subtracting interest expense from Profit Before Tax).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Consolidated Financial Statements (as of March 31, 2024):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Debt-to-Equity Ratio:</strong> (Total Debt / Shareholders&rsquo; Equity) = ₹237.11 million / ₹9,613.20 million = <strong>0.025</strong> (Note:  Long-term debt is approximated using the sum of long-term lease liabilities and deferred tax liabilities. Other long-term elements within provisions are not included.  Non-controlling interest is included in the denominator.)</li>
<li><strong>Debt-to-Assets Ratio:</strong> (Total Debt / Total Assets) = ₹237.11 million / ₹16,536.64 million = <strong>0.014</strong> (Using the same approximation for long-term debt as above.)</li>
<li><strong>Interest Coverage Ratio:</strong> (EBIT / Interest Expense) = ₹3,550.20 million / ₹26.58 million = <strong>133.40</strong> (EBIT calculated from Profit Before Tax and Interest Expense.)</li>
</ul>
<p>All ratio values are approximate.   The consolidated ratios reflect the use of the entire group, while the standalone ratios reflect only the parent company&rsquo;s leverage. The discrepancies are due to including the financials of subsidiaries and joint ventures.  The low debt-to-equity and debt-to-assets ratios indicate that Triveni Turbine Limited uses very little debt financing and has a very conservative capital structure. The very high interest coverage ratios show that the company has a substantial capacity to pay its interest obligations.  More accurate use calculations would require a more precise identification of all debt items, including those potentially embedded within other categories in the financial statements. All values are in Indian Rupees (₹) except for the interest coverage ratio which is a multiple.</p>

</h3>
<p>Several of these metrics require information not explicitly provided in the annual report itself.  The annual report provides the market capitalization at a specific point in time (March 31, 2024), but doesn&rsquo;t give the share price used to calculate the PE ratio, or provide net income figures required for the dividend payout ratio calculation.</p>
<p><strong>Data from the Annual Report:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Market Capitalization (as of March 31, 2024):</strong> ₹170.6 billion (This is stated directly in the Chairman&rsquo;s message.)</li>
<li><strong>Dividend per Share (FY2023-24):</strong> ₹3.60 (This is stated in the Directors&rsquo; Report)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Calculations Requiring Additional Data:</strong></p>
<p>To calculate the Price-to-Earnings ratio (PE ratio), Price-to-Book ratio (PB ratio), and Dividend Payout Ratio, we need the following data, which is not included in the provided document:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Share Price:</strong> The market price of the company&rsquo;s shares at a specific date.  Using the high and low prices listed over the year doesn&rsquo;t provide an accurate average for the entire year for PE ratio calculations.</li>
<li><strong>Number of Outstanding Shares:</strong> The exact number of shares outstanding at the end of the fiscal year might not exactly match the number used in the EPS calculation.  A more precise figure from the company is necessary for a perfectly accurate market capitalization and dividend payout ratio calculation.</li>
<li><strong>Net Income (PAT) for the year:</strong> While the consolidated PAT is given, we need a single yearly figure, not two for consolidated and standalone calculations, for the dividend payout ratio.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Dividend Yield:</strong></p>
<p>Dividend Yield = (Annual Dividend per Share / Share Price) * 100</p>
<p>We need the share price to calculate this.</p>
<p><strong>Dividend Payout Ratio:</strong></p>
<p>Dividend Payout Ratio = (Total Dividends Paid / Net Income) * 100</p>
<p>We need the total dividends paid (and precise net income) for the consolidated financial statement to accurately calculate this.  The annual report gives the dividend <em>per share</em>, but not the total amount paid.</p>
<p><strong>In Summary:</strong></p>
<p>While the market capitalization is available, calculating the PE ratio, PB ratio, dividend yield, and dividend payout ratio accurately requires additional information (share price, precise number of shares, etc.) beyond what&rsquo;s included in the provided annual report.</p>

  ESG Initiatives
  <a class="anchor" href="#esg-initiatives">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Triveni Turbine Limited&rsquo;s annual report details various Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) initiatives. Here&rsquo;s a summary:</p>
<p><strong>I. Environmental Initiatives:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Energy Conservation:</strong>  The company implemented various measures to reduce energy consumption, resulting in a 12% reduction in energy consumption per rupee of turnover.  This includes using variable frequency drives, switching to LED lighting, and implementing Kaizen processes.  Significant investments were also made in rooftop solar power plants at both its manufacturing facilities (Peenya and Sompura), generating a considerable amount of renewable energy.</li>
<li><strong>Emissions Reduction:</strong>  TTL achieved a more than 20% reduction in SOx and NOx emissions and an 8% reduction in Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions per rupee of turnover.  The report attributes this to efficiency improvements and the increased use of renewable energy.</li>
<li><strong>Water Conservation:</strong> The company focuses on water conservation and waste elimination, aiming for zero liquid discharge (ZLD) facilities.  Rainwater harvesting and the use of soak pits are also implemented. A Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) treats wastewater for reuse.</li>
<li><strong>Waste Management:</strong> TTL implemented measures to reduce and responsibly manage waste, including plastic, E-waste, and other hazardous waste. The report emphasizes recycling efforts and compliance with environmental regulations.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>II. Carbon Footprint:</strong></p>
<p>The report provides data on GHG emissions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Scope 1 and 2 Emissions:</strong> 3,374.68 metric tons of CO2 equivalent (FY2024) and 3,073.68 metric tons of CO2 equivalent (FY2023).</li>
<li><strong>Intensity:</strong>  The report calculates Scope 1 and 2 emission intensity per rupee of turnover and per unit of physical output (turbines produced).  It shows a reduction in emission intensity.</li>
<li><strong>Scope 3 Emissions:</strong>  The report notes that Scope 3 emissions were not calculated for the current year.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>III. Social Initiatives:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Employee Welfare:</strong>  TTL prioritizes employee safety and well-being, offering health insurance, accident insurance, and other benefits.  The company also emphasizes training and development programs, aiming for continuous skill enhancement and a various and inclusive workplace.</li>
<li><strong>Community Engagement:</strong>  The company undertakes various Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiatives focusing on education (Masterclass series on emerging technologies, support for underprivileged schools), healthcare (free screening and therapy for children with developmental issues), and technology development (collaboration with academic institutions).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>IV. Governance Practices:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Board Composition:</strong> The board of directors has a balance of executive, non-executive, and independent directors, promoting diversity of thought and experience.  The report details the composition of various board committees (Audit, Nomination and Remuneration, Stakeholders&rsquo; Relationship, CSR, Risk Management, Technology, Finance &amp; Investment, and Operations Committees), highlighting their roles in corporate governance.</li>
<li><strong>Compliance:</strong> The company adheres to all applicable laws, regulations, and corporate governance guidelines.  It emphasizes its robust internal financial controls, compliance monitoring mechanisms, and vigil mechanism for reporting ethical concerns.</li>
<li><strong>Whistleblower Policy:</strong> A whistleblower policy protects employees who report unethical behavior.</li>
<li><strong>Ethical Practices:</strong> Commitment to maintaining high standards of business ethics and transparency.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>V. Sustainability Goals:</strong></p>
<p>Specific, quantified sustainability goals are not explicitly laid out in the report. While progress and achievements in various ESG areas are described, the report doesn&rsquo;t set out ambitious targets for future performance (e.g., emission reduction targets by a specific year, renewable energy targets, etc.).  The report focuses more on the progress made and describes its focus areas than setting out explicit goals.</p>
<p>In summary, Triveni Turbine Limited demonstrates a commitment to ESG through various environmental and social initiatives and sound governance practices.  However, the lack of clearly defined and quantified sustainability goals limits a detailed evaluation of its long-term sustainability strategy.  The reporting focuses more on describing initiatives rather than setting specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) targets.</p>

</h3>
<p>The annual report provides the following information regarding R&amp;D expenditure and employee count:</p>
<p><strong>R&amp;D Expenditure (for the year ended March 31, 2024):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Standalone:</strong> ₹194.16 million (1.41% of turnover)</li>
<li><strong>Consolidated:</strong> ₹194.16 million (1.17% of turnover)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Employee Count (as of March 31, 2024):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Standalone:</strong> 751 permanent employees (excluding trainees)</li>
<li><strong>Consolidated:</strong> 850 employees (812 male, 38 female)  (This includes both permanent and non-permanent employees).</li>

  Audit Information
  <a class="anchor" href="#audit-information">#</a>
</h3>
<p>The auditor&rsquo;s opinion and key accounting policies are provided separately for the standalone and consolidated financial statements.</p>
<p><strong>I. Auditor&rsquo;s Opinion:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Standalone Financial Statements:</strong>  The independent auditor, Walker Chandiok &amp; Co LLP, expressed an <em>unmodified (clean)</em> opinion on the standalone financial statements. This means they found the statements to be fairly presented in accordance with Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) and other applicable accounting principles. The report did note one key audit matter related to the write-down of inventories to net realizable value, given the inherent subjectivity involved in this process.</p>
<p><strong>Consolidated Financial Statements:</strong>  Walker Chandiok &amp; Co LLP also issued an <em>unmodified (clean)</em> opinion on the consolidated financial statements.  They stated that the consolidated statements fairly present the financial position and performance of the group, considering the reports from other auditors who audited the financial statements of subsidiaries and joint ventures.  Again, a key audit matter concerning inventory write-downs was highlighted.</p>
<p><strong>II. Key Accounting Policies:</strong></p>
<p>Both the standalone and consolidated financial statements use the same key accounting policies, which are detailed in Note 1 of both sets of statements.  Key aspects include:</p>
<ul>
<li>

The historical cost convention is generally followed, with exceptions for certain assets and liabilities measured at fair value.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Revenue Recognition:</strong> Revenue is recognized when control of goods or services transfers to the customer, applying the principles of Ind AS 115, Revenue from Contracts with Customers.

</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Impairment of Non-Financial Assets:</strong> Assets are tested for impairment whenever indicators suggest that carrying amounts may not be recoverable.</p>
</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dividends:</strong> Recognized when declared.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cash and Cash Equivalents:</strong> Include cash on hand, short-term, highly liquid investments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Earnings Per Share:</strong> Calculated in accordance with Ind AS.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Financial Assets:</strong>  Classified as measured subsequently at fair value or at amortized cost, depending on the business model and cash flow characteristics.  Impairment is recognized using the expected credit loss model.</p>
</li>
