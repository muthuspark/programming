<li><strong>Revenue Growth Sensitivity:</strong> The 15-17% revenue growth target for FY 2024-25 is contingent upon successful and timely execution of the existing order book and the anticipated order inflow of â¹25,000 Crore. Delays in project execution or lower-than-expected order acquisition could negatively impact revenue growth.</li>
<li><strong>Capex Impact:</strong> The creation of five new factories and ongoing infrastructure upgrades are expected to enhance operational efficiency and production capacity. Delays or cost overruns in these projects could impact profitability.</li>
<li><strong>Indigenization Impact:</strong> BEL reports 77% of their turnover in indigenized products. Increased commitment to government&rsquo;s Make In India initiative will grow capabilities.</li>
<li><strong>Market Condition Impact:</strong> Delays or cost overruns in capital expenditure projects and new strategic business units could impact future profitability and efficiency.</li>
<li><strong>Technological Disruption Sensitivity:</strong> Focus on R&amp;D (6.24% of turnover invested) is crucial for maintaining competitiveness. Failure to keep pace with technological advancements could erode the market position, especially in emerging technology areas like network &amp; cyber security and unmanned systems.</li>
<li><strong>Cost Reduction Initiatives:</strong> The success of cost reduction initiatives will be critical in maintaining profitability, especially in the context of rising competition and potential supply chain cost pressures.</li>
