</h4>
<p>The resolution plan submitted by Ebix Singapore Pte Ltd. was approved by the NCLT on October 9, 2023. However, the plan has not yet been implemented.
The Resolution Professional (RP) has been directed by the NCLT to act as a caretaker, discharging the functions of an IP as RP, pending the implementation of the plan.
There are ongoing legal challenges, with Ebix appealing against the plan approval order. The NCLAT dismissed Ebix&rsquo;s appeal on February 23, 2024, upholding the NCLT&rsquo;s approval. Further, an appeal made by Ebix, at Supreme court, have been dismissed.
Current Status (as of the provided documents): The matter is listed before the NCLT, with the SRA (Ebix) failing to implement the plan and make payment to the ERP.</p>

<p>Due to CIRP, operations have been running with very limited staff and resources. The resignation of key personnel, including senior management, has led to non-compliance with several provisions of the Companies Act, 2013 and SEBI LODR 2015, attracting penalties.</p>

<p>This analysis examines Educomp Solutions Limited&rsquo;s risk profile based on the information available in the provided 30th Annual Report. It categorizes risks and assesses their severity, likelihood, trend, mitigation strategies, control effectiveness, and potential financial impact.</p>
<p><strong>Overarching Context:</strong> Educomp Solutions Limited is under Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP) since May 30, 2017. The powers of the Board of Directors are suspended, and a Resolution Professional (now acting as Caretaker Resolution Professional) is managing the company&rsquo;s affairs. A resolution plan was approved by the NCLT on October 9, 2023, but is not yet implemented. This status profoundly impacts all risk categories. Because of this CIRP, Financial information is limited, especially regarding subsidiaries.</p>

<li><strong>Specific Risks:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Business Model Obsolescence:</strong> The company&rsquo;s traditional education technology model (Smartclass, etc.) faces a high risk of becoming obsolete due to rapid technological advancements and the shift towards online/digital learning (Education 4.0), as highlighted in the Management Discussion and Analysis (MDA).</li>
<li><strong>Dependence on Resolution Plan:</strong> The company&rsquo;s entire future strategy hinges on the successful implementation of the resolution plan, which has faced significant delays and legal challenges.</li>
<li><strong>Loss of Market Share:</strong> Due to the company&rsquo;s financial distress, it is highly likely that they have lost, and continue to lose, significant market share to competitors.</li>
<li><strong>Loss of Control over Subsidiaries:</strong> Loss of control over subsidiaries as well as CIRP proceeding initiated against them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Analysis:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Severity:</strong> High. The company&rsquo;s survival is at stake.</li>
<li><strong>Likelihood:</strong> High. The resolution plan&rsquo;s implementation is uncertain.</li>
<li><strong>Trend:</strong> Negative. Delays and legal challenges worsen the situation.</li>
<li><strong>Mitigation Strategies:</strong> Largely dependent on the Resolution Professional&rsquo;s actions and the outcome of legal proceedings. The company&rsquo;s ability to independently mitigate strategic risks is severely limited.</li>
<li><strong>Control Effectiveness:</strong> Very Low. The company has limited control over its strategic direction.</li>

<li><strong>Service Delivery Disruptions:</strong> The company&rsquo;s ability to maintain service levels to existing clients is severely compromised due to financial constraints and staff limitations.</li>
<li><strong>Infrastructure and Technology Degradation:</strong> Inability to invest in technology upgrades and maintenance poses a significant risk.</li>
<li><strong>Contractual Defaults:</strong> The moratorium under CIRP prevents enforcement of certain contracts, but post-CIRP, the company may face numerous defaults.</li>
<li><strong>Loss of Assets:</strong> The report mentions assets that had been attached by the enforcement directorate.</li>

  Summary
  <a class="anchor" href="#summary">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Educomp Solutions Limited faces severe risks across all categories. The company&rsquo;s survival is entirely contingent on the resolution plan&rsquo;s success and subsequent effective restructuring. The financial impact of the identified risks has largely materialized, and the company&rsquo;s ability to mitigate these risks independently is extremely limited. The overarching trend is negative, and the control effectiveness is very low across most risk areas.</p>

<li>Developing case studies and research on global challenges.</li>

<h3 class="heading" id="governance-structure-and-effectiveness">
  Governance Structure and Effectiveness
  <a class="anchor" href="#governance-structure-and-effectiveness">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Educomp Solutions Limited is under the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP). This means the Board of Directors&rsquo; powers are suspended, and a Resolution Professional (RP), and now a Caretaker Resolution Professional, is in charge. As of March 31, 2024, there were no directors on the board. The report repeatedly notes non-compliance with various provisions of the Companies Act, 2013, and SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, due to the suspended board and CIRP.</p>
<p>Non-compliance includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lack of a properly constituted Board with independent directors.</li>
<li>Absence of board committees.</li>
<li>No board meetings.</li>
<li>No independent director declarations.</li>
<li>Delays in or failure to file financial results and other required disclosures.</li>
<li>Lack of Secretarial Compliance report.</li>
</ul>
<p>The governance structure is highly atypical and ineffective in the traditional sense due to the CIRP. The company is under the control of the Resolution Professional, and standard corporate governance practices are largely suspended.</p>

Educomp is under investigation by the Serious Fraud Investigation Office (SFIO) and the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). The document contains no forward-looking statements regarding preparation for future ESG-related regulations or expectations. Educomp is significantly non-compliant with existing regulations and demonstrates no evidence of preparing for future ESG-related regulations.
