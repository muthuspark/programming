Water intensity: 0.011 kilolitres/ H million. Diversity &amp; Inclusion: 15% women in the total workforce. Management Outlook # The Company expects to return to its previous growth momentum, driven by increased pride in Indian wear and an under-penetrated market. Focus remains on transitioning from “some Indian wear” to “only Indian wear” in every wardrobe, and promoting Indian wear for everyday use. The business model is designed to capitalize on increasing demand and generate larger surplus for value creation. Detailed Analysis # Strategic and Management Analysis of Vedant Fashions Limited # Long-Term Strategic Goals and Progress # Vedant Fashion’s long-term strategic goal is to transition from “some Indian wear in a wardrobe” to “only Indian wear in every wardrobe,” indicating an aim for dominant market share and brand pervasiveness in the Indian wear segment. Expansion of retail footprint is a stated goal, with the company reporting 1.7 million sq. ft. of global retail space and the addition of 5 new exclusive brand outlets of Twamev and the first flagship EBO store of Mohey Brand, and the largest store of Manyavar and Mohey Brand, showcasing quantitative progress in physical expansion. Expansion into international markets with Indian diaspora presence (USA, Canada, UK, UAE) has been initiated and represents a long-term growth area. Approved a draft scheme (the Scheme) for amalgamation of Manyavar Creations Private Limited (MCPL), a wholly owned subsidiary, with the Company. Competitive Advantages and Market Positioning # Vedant Fashions is positioned as a market leader in the branded Indian wedding and celebration wear market, specifically in the men’s category, supported by statements about its “Manyavar” brand. A diversified brand portfolio (Manyavar, Mohey, Twamev, Manthan, and Mebaz) addresses various customer segments and price points (mid-premium to premium). The company benefits from high brand recall and a “synonymous” association with Indian wedding and celebration wear. A “no end-of-season sales or discounts” policy for the Manyavar brand suggests strong pricing power and brand equity. An asset-light model, with a significant portion of production outsourced, contributes to capital efficiency. Innovation Initiatives and R&amp;D Effectiveness # The company emphasizes technology integration, utilizing data analytics for demand forecasting, inventory replenishment, and understanding customer preferences. Progress is evident in the strengthening of cloud operation and computing, increased data-driven decision-making, and algorithmic maturity in resource procurement and product supply. Implementation of Salesforce and other technologies demonstrate a commitment to digital transformation for improved outcomes in customer experience. M&amp;A Strategy and Execution # The 2017 acquisition of “Mebaz” is the only explicit M&amp;A activity mentioned, suggesting a selective approach to acquisitions focused on regional expansion or segment diversification. The Board of Directors has approved the draft scheme of amalgamation for Manyavar Creations Private Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary. Management’s Track Record in Execution # Management has overseen the growth of the company from a small venture to a pan-India presence, indicating a successful track record in scaling the business. Investments in technology, such as ERP early in the company’s history, demonstrate a proactive approach to systems and data-driven decision-making. The maintenance of high gross and PAT margins, coupled with a strong ROCE, suggests effective operational and financial management. CRISIL’s upgrade of the Company’s credit rating to AA/Stable indicates confidence in the managements ability to run a resilient business. Capital Allocation Strategy # The company follows an asset-light model, prioritizing internal accruals over debt financing, which contributes to a debt-free balance sheet and high liquidity. Investments are made in retail expansion, brand promotion, and technology, suggesting a focus on organic growth and operational efficiency. A dividend payout for FY 2023-24 of INR 8.50 per share demonstrates a commitment to returning value to shareholders. Purchase of 700 tonnes of carbon credit to offset the total Scope 1 &amp; 2 GHG emissions. Organizational Changes and Their Impact # The company is stated to be transitioning from “individualisation to institutionalisation,” signifying a move towards a more structured, system-driven organization. The re-designation of Vedant Modi from Chief Marketing Officer to Chief Revenue Officer, along with the appointment of Anand Narang as Chief Marketing and Digital Officer, indicates an evolving leadership structure, possibly to strengthen the revenue generation focus. Branded Fashion Apparel and Accessories: Forward Outlook # Management Guidance and Assumptions # Management’s primary objective is to enhance long-term stakeholder value sustainably. The Company’s culture is built around entrepreneurship, staying ahead of the market curve, and a consumer-centric approach. Management believes a systems-driven approach empowers informed decision-making, liberating management bandwidth for strategic thinking. Management has focused on technology investment as a driver of business growth, not an outcome, with systems for demand forecasting, design, manufacturing, and store replenishment. Management emphasizes “Only Indian wear in every wardrobe,” expanding beyond weddings to include everyday wear. Management prioritizes financial hygiene, sustaining margins and capital efficiency and attractive profitability. Management assumes that consistent focus on cost efficiency, value-added products and stringent working capital management will ensure steady margins. Market Growth Forecasts # The Indian men’s wedding and celebration wear market was projected to increase to around INR 18,000 Crore by 2025. Credit rating agency Crisil expects the Indian wear market to grow 15% to 17% to nearly INR 1.38 trillion by 2025. The market is expected to grow annually, along with growing population. The market is predicted to shift from unbranded to branded segments. Planned Strategic Initiatives # Continued retail expansion, broad-basing presence from weddings to festive wear. Deeper penetration into the Indian market and expansion in international locations with a significant Indian diaspora. Strengthening the brand through a “trustable fixed price” approach. Enhancing the communication of emotion and extending appeal to all wedding attendees. Cross-sell premium offerings to existing Manyavar Customers. Continue to leverage data analysis and market research to understand fashion trends and customer preferences. Further implementation of digital solutions like e-agreements and e-invoicing to reduce reliance on paper. Continue to strengthen the operating culture around algorithmic maturity. Strengthening cyber security, ahead of GDPR requirements. Using technology to map consumer preferences and enhance the in-store customer experience. Enhance data automation and extract superior data quality. Ongoing permutations across colors, fabrics, designs, cuts, threads, and stitches. Capital Expenditure Plans # The Company reinvests earnings into the business with the focus on responsible automation. The Capex is stated in the financials as 32.08 (for intangible assets) Efficiency Improvement Targets # Increased inventory turns and enhanced working capital efficiency. Optimizing resource use through technology, including automated demand forecasting and inventory replenishment. Lower overall cost of staying in business. Declining time-to-market for new products. Quicker understanding of market realities. Achieved operational efficiency and accuracy through the implementation of warehouse management system. Potential Challenges and Opportunities # Challenges: A decline in the number of weddings and general consumer weakness were cited as challenges faced in FY 24. High concentration on Indian wedding and celebration wear, making the Company vulnerable to variations in demand. Changes in consumer preferences present a risk. Potential cybersecurity risks, requiring strengthening ahead of GDPR requirements. Opportunities: The growing groundswell of pride in Indian wear presents a significant opportunity. Under-penetration of Indian wear in wardrobes provides substantial room for growth. The opportunity to cater to increased affluence and evolving consumer preferences, particularly in the premium segment. Deepening cultural bonds among fashion enthusiasts. The opportunity to expand and have larger market growth through increase consumer behaviour towards Indian wear. Scenario Analysis and Sensitivity # Sensitivity to Key Assumptions: Profitability is sensitive to maintaining high gross margins, efficient working capital management, and controlling operating expenses. Changes in these assumptions could significantly alter the financial outlook.">
