  <meta property="og:description" content="Overview # Comprehensive Analysis # This analysis delves into Patel Engineering Ltd.’s (PEL) Annual Report for FY2023-24, covering financial performance, business segments, risk factors, and ESG initiatives.
I. Financial Performance:
PEL demonstrated robust financial growth in FY24, building on the positive momentum of recent years. Key highlights include:
Significant Revenue Growth: Consolidated revenue from operations increased by 16.78% YoY to ₹45,441.08 million, while standalone revenue grew by 15.59% to ₹44,120.39 million. This growth reflects strong execution across various projects. Improved Profitability: Consolidated Operating EBITDA increased by 22.92% YoY to ₹6,902.94 million, and standalone Operating EBITDA grew by 14.73% to ₹6,201.05 million. This indicates improved operational efficiency and margin expansion. Substantial Net Profit Increase: Consolidated net profit surged by 70.60% YoY to ₹2,641.00 million, with standalone net profit rising by 84.90% to ₹2,881.80 million. This reflects improved profitability and debt reduction efforts. EPS Growth: Basic EPS from continuing operations increased to ₹3.64, indicating enhanced shareholder value. Debt Reduction: While gross debt increased slightly to ₹18,855 million, the company actively reduced its net serviceable debt by ₹3,310 million, primarily through settlement of arbitration awards under the Vivad Se Vishwas scheme (₹1,300 million) and an international arbitration award (₹1,500 million in Q1 FY25). A further ₹4,000 million was raised through a Qualified Institutional Placement (QIP) in Q1 FY25, aimed at further debt reduction and working capital improvement. Credit rating upgrades from BBB&#43; to A- reflect this improved financial position. II. Business Segments:">

<p>This analysis delves into Patel Engineering Ltd.&rsquo;s (PEL) Annual Report for FY2023-24, covering financial performance, business segments, risk factors, and ESG initiatives.</p>
<p><strong>I. Financial Performance:</strong></p>
<p>PEL demonstrated robust financial growth in FY24, building on the positive momentum of recent years.  Key highlights include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Significant Revenue Growth:</strong> Consolidated revenue from operations increased by 16.78% YoY to ₹45,441.08 million, while standalone revenue grew by 15.59% to ₹44,120.39 million.  This growth reflects strong execution across various projects.</li>
<li><strong>Improved Profitability:</strong> Consolidated Operating EBITDA increased by 22.92% YoY to ₹6,902.94 million, and standalone Operating EBITDA grew by 14.73% to ₹6,201.05 million.  This indicates improved operational efficiency and margin expansion.</li>
<li><strong>Substantial Net Profit Increase:</strong> Consolidated net profit surged by 70.60% YoY to ₹2,641.00 million, with standalone net profit rising by 84.90% to ₹2,881.80 million. This reflects improved profitability and debt reduction efforts.</li>
<li><strong>EPS Growth:</strong> Basic EPS from continuing operations increased to ₹3.64, indicating enhanced shareholder value.</li>
<li><strong>Debt Reduction:</strong> While gross debt increased slightly to ₹18,855 million, the company actively reduced its net serviceable debt by ₹3,310 million, primarily through settlement of arbitration awards under the Vivad Se Vishwas scheme (₹1,300 million) and an international arbitration award (₹1,500 million in Q1 FY25).  A further ₹4,000 million was raised through a Qualified Institutional Placement (QIP) in Q1 FY25, aimed at further debt reduction and working capital improvement.  Credit rating upgrades from BBB+ to A- reflect this improved financial position.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>II. Business Segments:</strong></p>
<p>PEL operates across diverse infrastructure sectors.  Segment-wise revenue break-up (standalone):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hydropower (50%):</strong>  PEL is a significant player in hydropower projects, boasting experience with projects ranging from 3MW to over 2,800MW.  They highlight executing approximately 45% of India&rsquo;s currently developing hydropower projects (around 8GW). Key projects include Dibang Multipurpose (2,880MW), Subansiri (2,000MW), Kiru (624MW), and Kwar (540MW).</li>
<li><strong>Irrigation (24%):</strong> This sector is expanding rapidly due to government initiatives like Jal Jeevan Mission and PMKSY.  PEL secured six new irrigation projects in FY24, totaling ₹28,009 million.</li>
<li><strong>Tunneling (15%):</strong>  PEL showcases expertise in various tunneling methods, including NATM and TBMs. The completion of the Sela Tunnel (world&rsquo;s longest bi-lane tunnel at over 13,000 ft) is a major highlight.  They also mention ongoing projects in Mumbai and Jammu &amp; Kashmir.</li>
<li><strong>Roads (5%):</strong> PEL participates in road construction projects, contributing to India&rsquo;s expanding national highway network.</li>
<li><strong>Urban Infrastructure &amp; Others (6%):</strong> This includes projects like the Narmada-Gambhir drinking water scheme and various buildings.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>III. Risk Factors:</strong></p>
<p>The annual report identifies several key risk factors:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Government Contract Dependency:</strong> PEL&rsquo;s heavy reliance on government contracts exposes it to policy changes, potential delays, modifications, or cancellations.  However, the report mitigates this by mentioning that many of their clients (Central PSUs) have strong balance sheets and that many contracts include escalation clauses.</li>
<li><strong>Economic and Political Uncertainty:</strong>  Global and domestic economic conditions, political instability, and fluctuations in interest and exchange rates pose significant risks.</li>
<li><strong>Natural Calamities and Communicable Diseases:</strong>  Events like the 2023 flash floods in Himachal Pradesh and the ongoing impact of pandemics can severely disrupt operations.</li>
<li><strong>Third-Party Subcontractor Performance:</strong>  PEL&rsquo;s reliance on subcontractors introduces risk related to non-performance or poor performance.  The report counters this by mentioning long-standing relationships with reliable subcontractors.</li>
<li><strong>Debt Rating Downgrade:</strong> A potential downgrade of India&rsquo;s debt rating could negatively impact the company&rsquo;s financial performance.  Conversely, the report highlights a credit rating upgrade, showcasing their improved financial health.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>IV. ESG Initiatives (Environmental, Social, and Governance):</strong></p>
<p>PEL&rsquo;s CSR activities focus on community empowerment and sustainability at project sites.  Key initiatives include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Disaster Relief:</strong> Providing aid to flood victims in Himachal Pradesh.</li>
<li><strong>Community Infrastructure:</strong>  Improving educational facilities, providing ambulance and bus services, and supplying essential commodities to medical dispensaries in project areas.</li>
<li><strong>Employment Generation:</strong>  Creating employment opportunities in remote areas.</li>
<li><strong>Technological Advancements:</strong>  Adopting advanced technologies like Roller Compacted Concrete (RCC) and the Tower Belt System to improve efficiency and reduce environmental impact (reducing diesel consumption and pollution).</li>
</ul>
<p>The report highlights specific projects demonstrating their commitment to ESG principles, like the eco-friendly construction methods used in the Kiru Hydroelectric Project.  However, a more detailed quantitative impact assessment of these CSR initiatives would enhance transparency.  The report mentions the inclusion of Business Responsibility and Sustainability Reporting (BRSR) but doesn&rsquo;t include it directly.</p>
<p><strong>V. Overall Assessment:</strong></p>
<p>PEL&rsquo;s annual report reveals a company experiencing significant growth and improved financial health.  Strategic debt reduction, coupled with a diversified order book and focus on large-scale infrastructure projects, positions them well for future growth. However, reliance on government contracts and exposure to macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties remain significant risks.  Strengthening the disclosure and quantitative measurement of their ESG impact would enhance the report’s overall credibility and appeal to investors concerned about sustainable investing.  The absence of the full BRSR report is a significant limitation to this assessment.</p>

<p>Using Patel Engineering Ltd.&rsquo;s Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss for the year ended March 31, 2024:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Revenue:</strong> ₹45,441.08 million</li>
<li><strong>Cost of Revenue (Cost of Construction):</strong> ₹38,538.14 million</li>
<li><strong>Gross Profit:</strong> ₹6,902.94 million (Revenue - Cost of Revenue)</li>
<li><strong>Operating Expenses:</strong>  This is not explicitly stated as a single line item.  Operating expenses are implicitly included within the &ldquo;Cost of Construction&rdquo; figure, which is presented as the main expense related to their core business.  Additional operating expenses (like employee benefits, depreciation, and other expenses) are also reported separately.  Summing these would provide a more complete picture of total operating expenses, but the report does not present this sum directly.</li>
<li><strong>Operating Income (Operating EBITDA):</strong> ₹6,902.94 million (This is presented directly in the report; it&rsquo;s a key profitability metric before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization are deducted.)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Note:</strong>  These figures are from the <em>consolidated</em> statement of profit and loss.  Standalone figures will differ.  The &ldquo;Cost of Construction&rdquo; in this report likely includes several expenses that might be categorized separately as operating expenses in other company reports.  Always specify whether you&rsquo;re referring to consolidated or standalone values when referencing these metrics.</p>

<p>Patel Engineering Ltd.&rsquo;s annual report does not explicitly state free cash flow.  To calculate free cash flow (FCF), we would need more information than is readily available in the provided text.  A typical FCF calculation subtracts capital expenditures from operating cash flow.  However, the report provides:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Capital Expenditure:</strong> This is not explicitly stated as a single figure.  The cash flow statement shows net cash <em>used</em> in investing activities, including capital expenditures, as ₹(1,323.37) million.  However, this figure also includes other investing activities like the purchase and sale of investments and changes in loans to JVs/associates.  A precise number for <em>only</em> capital expenditure is not available.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dividends Paid:</strong> The report explicitly states that <em>no dividend</em> was paid for the financial year 2023-24.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To accurately calculate free cash flow, we would need a detailed breakdown of the investing cash flows to isolate capital expenditures specifically. This information isn&rsquo;t directly provided in the supplied annual report excerpt.</p>

<p>Profitability ratios for Patel Engineering Ltd. based on its <em>consolidated</em> financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2024.  Note that precise calculations may vary slightly depending on rounding and the exact figures used.  These are approximations based on the information provided:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Gross Profit Margin:</strong> (Operating EBITDA / Revenue) * 100 = (₹6,902.94 million / ₹45,441.08 million) * 100 = 15.19%</li>
<li><strong>Operating Profit Margin:</strong> (Operating EBITDA / Revenue) * 100 = (₹6,902.94 million / ₹45,441.08 million) * 100 = 15.19% (This is the same as Gross Margin because the report presents Operating EBITDA.  A different operating margin would result if we had operating income or profit before tax)</li>
<li><strong>Net Profit Margin:</strong> (Net Profit / Revenue) * 100 = (₹3,022.10 million / ₹46,330.16 million) * 100 = 6.52%</li>
<li><strong>Return on Equity (ROE):</strong> (Net Profit / Average Shareholder&rsquo;s Equity) * 100 = (₹3,022.10 million / [(₹28,879.56 million + ₹31,536.19 million) / 2]) * 100 = 10.04% (approximately)</li>
<li><strong>Return on Assets (ROA):</strong> (Net Profit / Average Total Assets) * 100 = (₹3,022.10 million / [(₹87,570.90 million + ₹89,961.25 million) / 2]) * 100 = 3.41% (approximately)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Considerations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Consolidated vs. Standalone:</strong> These ratios are calculated using <em>consolidated</em> financial data.  Standalone ratios, reflecting only the Company&rsquo;s performance, would be different.</li>
<li><strong>EBITDA vs. Net Income:</strong> The gross and operating profit margins use EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization).  A different margin would result if we used operating income or profit before tax.</li>
<li><strong>Average Equity and Assets:</strong> ROE and ROA calculations use the average of the beginning and ending balance sheet values for equity and total assets, respectively.</li>
<li><strong>Rounding:</strong>  Slight variations may occur due to rounding in the provided financial figures.</li>

</h3>
<p>To calculate liquidity ratios for Patel Engineering Ltd., we&rsquo;ll use its <em>consolidated</em> financial statements as of March 31, 2024. Remember that standalone figures will differ. Also note that precise calculations might vary slightly based on rounding. These are approximations based on the available information:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Current Ratio:</strong> Current Assets / Current Liabilities = ₹58,174.23 million / ₹40,165.56 million = 1.45</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Quick Ratio:</strong> (Current Assets - Inventories) / Current Liabilities = (₹58,174.23 million - ₹37,918.59 million) / ₹40,165.56 million = 0.50</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cash Ratio:</strong> (Cash and Cash Equivalents) / Current Liabilities = ₹3,387.54 million / ₹40,165.56 million = 0.08</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Considerations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Consolidated vs. Standalone:</strong> These ratios are calculated using <em>consolidated</em> financial data. Standalone ratios would differ.</li>
<li><strong>Rounding:</strong> Minor discrepancies might arise due to rounding of the figures provided in the report.</li>
</ul>
<p>It&rsquo;s crucial to always specify whether you&rsquo;re using consolidated or standalone data when discussing these liquidity ratios.  The information provided in the report doesn&rsquo;t directly give total cash and equivalents but only the current portion.  A more precise cash ratio calculation may result if the total cash and equivalents were available.</p>

  Efficiency Ratios
  <a class="anchor" href="#efficiency-ratios">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Calculating efficiency ratios for Patel Engineering Ltd. requires using its <em>consolidated</em> financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2024. Remember that standalone ratios will be different.  These calculations are approximations, as precise figures may vary slightly due to rounding:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Asset Turnover:</strong> Revenue / Average Total Assets = ₹45,441.08 million / [(₹81,314.27 million + ₹89,961.25 million) / 2] = 0.53 (approximately)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Inventory Turnover:</strong> Cost of Revenue / Average Inventory = ₹38,538.14 million / [(₹36,762.97 million + ₹37,918.59 million) / 2] = 1.03 (approximately)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Receivables Turnover:</strong> Revenue / Average Accounts Receivable = ₹45,441.08 million / [(₹5,038.74 million + ₹5,539.21 million)/2] = 8.59 (approximately)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Considerations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Consolidated vs. Standalone:</strong>  These ratios are based on <em>consolidated</em> financial data. Standalone values will be different.</li>
<li><strong>Average Values:</strong>  The calculations for asset turnover, inventory turnover, and receivables turnover use the average of the beginning and ending balances for the respective line items.</li>
<li><strong>Rounding:</strong> Minor discrepancies may exist due to rounding of the numbers presented in the report.</li>
<li><strong>Inventory Turnover Interpretation:</strong> The relatively low inventory turnover ratio (1.03) might indicate that the company is holding onto inventory longer than might be considered optimal, this however is consistent with the industry norms.</li>
</ul>
<p>It&rsquo;s essential to always specify whether you are using consolidated or standalone data when you present and discuss these efficiency ratios.</p>

  Leverage Ratios
  <a class="anchor" href="#leverage-ratios">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Let&rsquo;s calculate the leverage ratios for Patel Engineering Ltd. using its <em>consolidated</em> financial statements as of March 31, 2024.  Remember that standalone figures will differ, and these are approximations due to rounding:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Debt-to-Equity Ratio:</strong> Total Debt / Total Equity = ₹18,854.92 million / ₹31,617.29 million = 0.60</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Debt-to-Assets Ratio:</strong> Total Debt / Total Assets = ₹18,854.92 million / ₹89,961.25 million = 0.21</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Interest Coverage Ratio:</strong> Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT) / Interest Expense =  This calculation requires EBIT. The report provides EBITDA and Profit Before Tax (PBT). To approximate, we can use PBT, but the true interest coverage will be higher as PBT excludes depreciation and amortization expenses.  Using PBT as an approximation: (₹4,051.12 million) / ₹3,620.94 million = 1.12 (approximately)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Considerations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Consolidated vs. Standalone:</strong> These ratios are based on <em>consolidated</em> financial data.  Standalone ratios will be different.</li>
<li><strong>EBIT Approximation:</strong>  The interest coverage ratio is approximated using PBT. Using EBIT would provide a more accurate figure.  The report doesn&rsquo;t include EBIT separately.</li>
<li><strong>Rounding:</strong> Small discrepancies can arise due to rounding in the financial statement figures.</li>

<p>The provided annual report excerpt does <em>not</em> contain information on market capitalization, price-to-earnings (PE) ratio, price-to-book (PB) ratio, dividend yield, or dividend payout ratio.  These are market-based ratios that require the company&rsquo;s stock price and the number of outstanding shares, which are not included in the provided text.  To calculate these ratios, you would need to obtain the current market price of Patel Engineering Ltd.&rsquo;s shares from a financial website such as Google Finance, Yahoo Finance, or Bloomberg.  You would then use the following formulas:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Market Capitalization:</strong>  Market Price per Share * Number of Outstanding Shares</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Price-to-Earnings Ratio (PE Ratio):</strong> Market Price per Share / Earnings per Share (EPS)</p>

  ESG Ratings
  <a class="anchor" href="#esg-ratings">#</a>
</h3>
<p>The provided annual report excerpt does <em>not</em> include ESG ratings from any rating agencies.  ESG ratings are typically provided by specialized agencies that assess a company&rsquo;s performance on environmental, social, and governance factors.  To find PEL&rsquo;s ESG ratings, you would need to consult independent ESG rating providers such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sustainalytics:</strong> Provides ESG risk ratings and scores.</li>
<li><strong>MSCI ESG Research:</strong> Offers ESG ratings and key performance indicators (KPIs).</li>
<li><strong>Bloomberg ESG Data:</strong>  A comprehensive database of ESG data and scores.</li>
<li><strong>Refinitiv:</strong> Offers ESG scores and analytics.</li>
<li><strong>ISS ESG:</strong> Provides ESG ratings and corporate governance assessments.</li>
</ul>
<p>These agencies use different methodologies and scoring systems, so ratings from different providers may vary.  You should consult multiple sources to get a comprehensive understanding of PEL&rsquo;s ESG performance.  The report&rsquo;s mention of including a BRSR (Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report) suggests that such a report may contain some relevant information, but the full report is not part of this excerpt.</p>
<h3 class="heading" id="esg-initiatives">
  ESG Initiatives
  <a class="anchor" href="#esg-initiatives">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Patel Engineering Ltd.&rsquo;s (PEL) annual report provides limited detail on its environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance.  The information available is qualitative rather than quantitative, lacking specific metrics and targets. Here&rsquo;s a summary based on the provided excerpt:</p>
<p><strong>I. Environmental Initiatives:</strong></p>
<p>The report emphasizes the use of technologies aimed at reducing environmental impact:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Roller Compacted Concrete (RCC):</strong> Using a mix of fly ash and cement in dam construction reduces cement consumption and the associated carbon emissions.</li>
<li><strong>Tower Belt System:</strong> This system replaces diesel-powered dumpers with an electric conveyor belt system for concrete transportation, reducing fuel consumption and pollution.</li>
<li><strong>Energy-efficient technologies:</strong>  The report mentions the use of various energy-efficient technologies, such as VFD starting systems for ventilation and cranes, and the use of larger diameter ducts and optimized electric compressors.  However, no specific data on energy consumption reduction or CO2 emissions is provided.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>II. Carbon Footprint:</strong></p>
<p>The annual report does <em>not</em> provide a quantitative assessment of PEL&rsquo;s carbon footprint.  This is a significant omission given the growing importance of carbon accounting and disclosure in ESG reporting.</p>
<p><strong>III. Social Initiatives:</strong></p>
<p>The report highlights several social initiatives focusing on community development and empowerment around project sites:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Disaster Relief:</strong> Providing aid to flood victims.</li>
<li><strong>Infrastructure Development:</strong> Improving local schools and other community facilities.</li>
<li><strong>Healthcare Support:</strong> Supplying essential commodities to medical dispensaries.</li>
<li><strong>Transportation:</strong> Providing ambulance and bus services to improve access to healthcare and transportation.</li>
<li><strong>Educational Support:</strong>  Providing educational aid to children from low-income families.</li>
</ul>
<p>While these initiatives are commendable, the report lacks specific metrics and details on the scale and impact of these programs.</p>
<p><strong>IV. Governance Practices:</strong></p>
<p>The annual report emphasizes adherence to good corporate governance principles, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Board Composition:</strong> The board includes a mix of executive and non-executive directors, with a significant number of independent directors.</li>
<li><strong>Committees:</strong>  The existence of various committees (Audit, Nomination &amp; Remuneration, Stakeholders&rsquo; Relationship, Risk Management, CSR) indicates a structured approach to corporate governance.</li>
<li><strong>Compliance:</strong> The report mentions compliance with applicable laws and regulations, including the SEBI Listing Regulations and the Companies Act, 2013.  However, it also notes an instance of non-compliance resulting in an administrative warning from SEBI related to the timing of Risk Management Committee meetings.</li>
</ul>
<p>Again, a comprehensive evaluation of governance practices requires more detailed information, including the specifics of committee activities and the company&rsquo;s internal controls.</p>
<p><strong>V. Sustainability Goals:</strong></p>
<p>The report does <em>not</em> explicitly state specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) sustainability goals. While the company showcases certain environmental initiatives, the absence of clear, quantified sustainability targets is a significant limitation.  The promised BRSR (Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report) likely contains more details on this, but that information isn&rsquo;t included in the excerpt.</p>
<p><strong>Overall Assessment:</strong></p>
<p>PEL&rsquo;s annual report touches upon various ESG aspects but lacks the detailed quantitative data and specific, measurable targets needed for a comprehensive ESG assessment. The information provided is largely descriptive and qualitative, limiting the ability to fully evaluate their ESG performance.  The absence of the full BRSR is a notable gap.  To get a fuller picture, one would need to obtain the complete BRSR and consult independent ESG rating agencies.</p>

<p><strong>Auditor&rsquo;s Opinion:</strong></p>
<p>The independent auditor, Vatsaraj &amp; Co., issued an unqualified opinion on both the consolidated and standalone financial statements of Patel Engineering Ltd. for the year ended March 31, 2024.  This means the auditors found the financial statements to be presented fairly, in all material respects, in accordance with Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) and other generally accepted accounting principles in India.</p>
<p>However, the auditor&rsquo;s report includes emphasis of matter paragraphs drawing attention to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Material Uncertainty Related to Going Concern:</strong> The financial statements of certain subsidiaries (Hera Realcon Private Limited, Shreeanant Construction Private Limited, and Energy Design Private Limited) include auditor&rsquo;s statements that draw attention to material uncertainties relating to going concern which may cast significant doubt on the respective company’s ability to continue as a going concern.  However, the financial statements of these subsidiaries are prepared on a going concern basis.  The auditor’s opinion is not modified in respect to this matter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Material Uncertainty Related to Dirang Energy Private Limited:</strong>  The auditor&rsquo;s report also highlights the temporary halt in operations of Dirang Energy Private Limited.  The financial statements of this subsidiary are prepared on a going concern basis, and the auditor’s opinion is not modified in respect to this matter.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Despite these emphasis of matter paragraphs, the overall auditor&rsquo;s opinion on the consolidated and standalone financial statements remains unqualified.</p>
<p><strong>Key Accounting Policies:</strong></p>
<p>The annual report outlines several key accounting policies used in preparing the financial statements.  These include, but are not limited to:</p>
