  Strategic Risks
  <a class="anchor" href="#strategic-risks">#</a>
</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Severity:</strong> High. Reliance on innovator molecules progressing to subsequent phases of clinical development and reliance on key clients are sources for material revenue loss.</li>
<li><strong>Likelihood:</strong> Medium. The pharmaceutical industry faces challenges, including late-stage asset failures.</li>
<li><strong>Trend:</strong> Increasing. The clinical pipeline growth and China Plus One dynamics are increasing RFQs, potentially exacerbating reliance on key clients and molecules. Phase III intermediates increased from 6 to 13, and molecules from 2 to 7.</li>
<li><strong>Mitigation Strategies:</strong> Scale and deepen existing relationships, scale up developmental revenues, move up the value chain. Build and deploy key account management.</li>
<li><strong>Control Effectiveness:</strong> Partially Effective. Increase in RFQs and conversion rates indicate some success, yet the core risks remain.</li>
<li><strong>Potential Financial Impact:</strong> Significant revenue decline if key molecules fail or key customer relationships are impacted. FY24 saw a revenue decline of 21.6% (Consolidated).</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="heading" id="operational-risks">
  Operational Risks
  <a class="anchor" href="#operational-risks">#</a>
</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Severity:</strong> Medium to High. Reliance on imports for Key Starting Materials (KSM) and Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs).</li>
<li><strong>Likelihood:</strong> Medium. Supply chain disruptions are mentioned as an industry headwind.</li>
<li><strong>Trend:</strong> Stable. The company recognizes the risk.</li>
<li><strong>Mitigation Strategies:</strong> Cost optimization strategies, supplier risk mitigation, and minimizing China dependence. Implemented 30+ cost-saving ideas.</li>
<li><strong>Control Effectiveness:</strong> Partially effective. Cost-saving measures and FDA audit clearances indicate operational controls, but import reliance remains.</li>
<li><strong>Potential Financial Impact:</strong> Delivery schedule delays.</li>

<li><strong>Mitigation Strategies:</strong> Cost optimization and supplier risk mitigation.</li>
<li><strong>Control Effectiveness:</strong> Partially effective. EBITDA margins are being maintained, but overall profitability has decreased.</li>
<li><strong>Potential Financial Impact:</strong>
