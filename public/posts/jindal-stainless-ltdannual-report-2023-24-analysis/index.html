<ul>
<li><strong>Severity:</strong> High, due to the potential impact on long-term growth and market position, especially given the joint ventures and acquisitions.</li>
<li><strong>Likelihood:</strong> Medium, considering the volatility of raw material prices (nickel) and increasing competition from imports.</li>
<li><strong>Trend:</strong> Increasing, with the company making significant strategic investments, like the joint venture in Indonesia and stake acquisitions.</li>
<li><strong>Mitigation Strategies:</strong> Backward integration (Indonesia NPI smelter), downstream capacity expansion, product diversification (long products, pipes and tubes), acquisition of Chromeni Steels Private Limited for wider market reach.</li>
<li><strong>Control Effectiveness:</strong> Partially effective. Backward integration mitigates raw material risk, but import competition remains a challenge.</li>

<li><strong>Mitigation Strategies:</strong> World Class Manufacturing (WCM) pillars, implementation of Production Planning and Detailed Scheduling &amp; Manufacturing solutions integrated with ERP, focus on digitization (IoT, analytics, AI/ML) and Industry 4.0 principles for operational efficiency and &lsquo;smart plant&rsquo; initiatives.
