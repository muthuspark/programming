  Analysis of Accounting Quality and Regulatory Risk Assessment
  <a class="anchor" href="#analysis-of-accounting-quality-and-regulatory-risk-assessment">#</a>
</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Accounting Quality:</strong> The unqualified audit opinion suggests a high level of accounting quality. However, the observation of periodic only backup of accounting data until December 17, 2023 and that SOC reports for audit trail records were not available for full year raises a minor concern about data integrity.</li>
<li><strong>Regulatory Risk:</strong> The Company faces regulatory risk primarily related to pending tax litigations. The contingent liabilities for tax matters are significant, indicating potential financial impact if the outcomes are unfavorable. The delay in transferring funds to the IEPF, even though due to technical issues, needs to be noted. The non-daily backup of books before December 18, 2023, and the missing SOC reports for complete financial year highlight a compliance gap.</li>
</ul>
