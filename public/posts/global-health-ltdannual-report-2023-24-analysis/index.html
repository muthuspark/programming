  Strategic Risks
  <a class="anchor" href="#strategic-risks">#</a>
</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Severity:</strong> High. The healthcare sector&rsquo;s growth is rapid, driven by rising demand, digital advancements, and affordability, yet faces significant gaps in tertiary care infrastructure.</li>
<li><strong>Likelihood:</strong> High, Given India&rsquo;s low bed density, especially outside major metropolitan areas (16 beds per 10,000 population vs. a recommended 30).</li>
<li><strong>Trend:</strong> Increasing demand in underserved areas (Uttar Pradesh and Bihar). Medanta added 126 new beds during the year, the Company&rsquo;s network of hospitals has expanded.</li>
<li><strong>Mitigation Strategies:</strong> Capacity expansion in underserved markets (Lucknow and Patna). Planned addition of beds in existing facilities and development of new hospitals (Noida, South Delhi, Indore, Mumbai). Expansion of &ldquo;Continuity of Care&rdquo; services.</li>
<li><strong>Control Effectiveness:</strong> Partially Effective. Existing hospitals demonstrate operational success. New projects face execution risks.</li>
<li><strong>Potential Financial Impact:</strong> Positive, long-term, if expansion is successful. Negative, if delays or operational inefficiencies occur, leading to increased capital expenditure without proportionate revenue increase.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="heading" id="operational-risks">
  Operational Risks
  <a class="anchor" href="#operational-risks">#</a>
</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Severity:</strong> Medium to High. Operational inefficiencies and high fixed costs can impact margins.</li>
<li><strong>Likelihood:</strong> Medium. Risks include rising non-variable operating costs and occupancy rate fluctuations, potentially impacting margins and business growth.</li>
<li><strong>Trend:</strong> Stable, with efforts to improve. Occupancy rate for FY 2023-24 was 62%. ALOS reduced to 3.23 days.</li>
<li><strong>Mitigation Strategies:</strong>
*Diversification of the business by establishing operations in multiple underserved healthcare regions.
*Focus on implementing the &lsquo;Medanta model of care&rsquo; across all locations.</li>
<li><strong>Control Effectiveness:</strong> Moderate. Positive trends in operational efficiency are evident, but ongoing monitoring and improvement are necessary.</li>
<li><strong>Potential Financial Impact:</strong> Operational inefficiencies could lead to increased costs and reduced profitability.</li>

  Financial Risks
  <a class="anchor" href="#financial-risks">#</a>
</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Severity:</strong> Medium.</li>
<li><strong>Likelihood:</strong> Low to Medium. Primarily related to capital expenditure and managing cash flows.</li>
<li><strong>Trend:</strong> Improving. Debt-to-equity ratio improved from 0.35 to 0.14 in FY 2023-24, indicating lower financial leverage.</li>
<li><strong>Mitigation Strategies:</strong> Maintaining a robust cash position. Net cash balance of ₹7,720 million as of March 31, 2024. Strategic expansion plans funded through a mix of internal accruals and borrowings.</li>
<li><strong>Control Effectiveness:</strong> High.</li>
<li><strong>Potential Financial Impact:</strong> Increased interest expenses and potential strain on cash flow if new projects face delays or cost overruns. Positive return on equity (17.93%) shows strong profitability relative to shareholder investment.</li>

<li><strong>Mitigation Strategies:</strong>
*Adhering to all regulatory requirements and guidelines.
*Implementation of robust internal control systems.
*Having comprehensive policies such as Whistle Blower Policy and POSH Policy.</li>
<li><strong>Control Effectiveness:</strong> High. No significant penalties or instances of non-compliance were reported.</li>
