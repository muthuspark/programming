I. Financial Performance:
CG Power reported a strong financial year, exceeding expectations despite a challenging global economic environment.
Revenue Growth: Standalone revenue grew by 16% YoY to ₹7,610 crore (US$ 916 million), while consolidated revenue increased by 15% to ₹8,046 crore (US$ 971 million). This growth is attributed to robust domestic demand, especially in infrastructure, power &amp; renewables, and railways. Profitability: Profit before tax (PBT) before exceptional items saw a 24% YoY increase to ₹1,146 crore (US$ 138 million) standalone and ₹1,137 crore (US$ 137 million) consolidated. EBITDA margins improved to 15.1% (standalone) and 14.1% (consolidated) from 14.1% and 13.6% respectively in FY23. This improvement stems from higher realizations, favorable product mix, cost efficiencies, and higher-margin export orders in Power Systems. Return on Capital Employed (ROCE): ROCE stood at 37% for FY24, indicating efficient capital utilization. Debt: The company achieved a debt-free status. This significantly improves the interest coverage ratio. Free Cash Flow: Generated ₹784 crore (US$ 95 million) in free cash flow. Order Book: A robust unexecuted order book of ₹6,276 crore (standalone) and ₹6,411 crore (consolidated) provides a strong foundation for future growth. This represents a 45% and 44% YoY increase respectively. II. Business Segments:">

<p><strong>I. Financial Performance:</strong></p>
<p>CG Power reported a strong financial year, exceeding expectations despite a challenging global economic environment.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Revenue Growth:</strong> Standalone revenue grew by 16% YoY to ₹7,610 crore (US$ 916 million), while consolidated revenue increased by 15% to ₹8,046 crore (US$ 971 million).

<li><strong>Profitability:</strong>  Profit before tax (PBT) before exceptional items saw a 24% YoY increase to ₹1,146 crore (US$ 138 million) standalone and ₹1,137 crore (US$ 137 million) consolidated. EBITDA margins improved to 15.1% (standalone) and 14.1% (consolidated) from 14.1% and 13.6% respectively in FY23.  This improvement stems from higher realizations, favorable product mix, cost efficiencies, and higher-margin export orders in Power Systems.</li>
<li><strong>Return on Capital Employed (ROCE):</strong> ROCE stood at 37% for FY24, indicating efficient capital utilization.</li>
<li><strong>Debt:</strong> The company achieved a debt-free status.  This significantly improves the interest coverage ratio.</li>
<li><strong>Free Cash Flow:</strong>  Generated ₹784 crore (US$ 95 million) in free cash flow.</li>
<li><strong>Order Book:</strong> A robust unexecuted order book of ₹6,276 crore (standalone) and ₹6,411 crore (consolidated) provides a strong foundation for future growth.  This represents a 45% and 44% YoY increase respectively.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>II. Business Segments:</strong></p>
<p>CG Power operates in two primary business segments: Industrial Systems and Power Systems.</p>
<p><strong>A. Industrial Systems:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Revenue:</strong> Standalone revenue increased by 10% YoY to ₹5,015 crore (US$ 607 million), with consolidated revenue at ₹5,429 crore (US$ 657 million).</li>
<li><strong>Key Drivers:</strong> Record sales in Low Tension Motors (LT), Large Industrial Machines (LIM), and Drives &amp; Automation.  LT Motors increased market share to 38%.  The Railways business also achieved record sales, pro/fits, and order intake.</li>
<li><strong>Growth Initiatives:</strong>  Significant investments in capacity expansion (₹35 crore for HT Motors, Bhopal).  Focus on new product development (IE5 Ultra-premium Ef/ficiency Motors, new pumps, fans, and water heaters).  Expansion into new application segments (Wind Turbine, Earth Mover applications).  Export growth strategy with a successful entry into the Brazilian market.</li>
<li><strong>Industry 4.0 Initiatives:</strong> Implementation of IoT, Machine Execution Systems (MES), and digitalization efforts across manufacturing units.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>B. Power Systems:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Revenue:</strong> Revenue surged by 28% YoY to ₹2,598 crore (US$ 315 million), driven by strong demand for transformers and switchgears fueled by increased government investment in the power sector.</li>
<li><strong>Profitability:</strong> Significant improvement in PBIT margin to 16% from 11.2% YoY.</li>
<li><strong>Growth Initiatives:</strong>  All-time high order intake (51% YoY growth).  Capacity expansion projects underway (₹155 crore for Switchgears, Nashik; ₹31 crore for Power Transformers, Bhopal).  New product development and indigenous manufacturing (800kV Bushings, Compact 66kV-145kV Gas Insulated Switchgear).</li>
<li><strong>Key Market Focus:</strong> Government&rsquo;s increased thrust on power infrastructure development created substantial opportunities.  Expansion into international markets (South America, Middle East, and Africa).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>III. Risks:</strong></p>
<p>The annual report identifies many key risks:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Capacity Expansion Delays:</strong>  Potential for delays in ongoing capacity expansion projects, impacting revenue and market share.</li>
<li><strong>EHS Standards:</strong> Risk of failing to uphold suf/ficient health and safety standards, leading to costs, liabilities, and reputational damage.  Mitigation efforts include robust safety policies, training programs, regular audits, and preventive maintenance.</li>
<li><strong>Talent Acquisition and Retention:</strong>  Dif/ficulties in attracting and retaining skilled employees.  The company is addressing this through talent development programs, mentorship opportunities, competitive compensation, and succession planning.</li>
<li><strong>Technological Obsolescence:</strong>  Risk of products becoming outdated.  The company mitigates this by investing in R&amp;D, collaborating with technology partners, and continually updating its product portfolio.</li>
<li><strong>Commodity and Currency Fluctuations:</strong>  Exposure to price volatility and import dependency.  Mitigation includes rate contracts, cost reduction initiatives, and maintaining reserve stocks of critical materials.</li>
<li><strong>Cybersecurity:</strong> The risk of cyberattacks and network breaches.  The company is implementing multiple layers of cybersecurity measures, conducting regular vulnerability assessments and penetration testing (VAPT), and implementing business continuity plans.</li>
<li><strong>Geopolitical Instability:</strong> Global events and their impact on markets and supply chain.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>IV. ESG Initiatives:</strong></p>
<p>CG Power demonstrates a strong commitment to Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) principles:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sustainability Report:</strong> Published its /first sustainability report, detailing ESG initiatives and performance.</li>
<li><strong>Carbon Neutrality Target:</strong>  Committed to achieving carbon neutrality (Scope 1 and 2 emissions) by 2030.</li>
<li><strong>Renewable Energy:</strong>  Significant investment in solar power plants across various manufacturing units.</li>
<li><strong>Waste Management:</strong> Initiatives to reduce waste generation (thermocol-free packaging, recycling programs), compliant with EPR regulations.</li>
<li><strong>Environmental Certi/fications:</strong> Multiple certi/fications received (GreenCo Silver, Single Use Plastic free, Life Cycle Assessment Carbon Footprint).</li>
<li><strong>Human Capital:</strong> Focus on employee health, safety, well-being (training, learning programs, and skill development).  Emphasis on diversity and inclusion.</li>
<li><strong>Corporate Governance:</strong>  Robust risk management framework, Board diversity, regular Board and Committee evaluations, and transparent financial reporting.</li>
<li><strong>Community Engagement:</strong> CSR initiatives focusing on education, healthcare, and community development.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>V. Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>CG Power and Industrial Solutions Limited demonstrates a strong financial performance with growth across its business segments. While the company faces certain risks associated with the global business landscape, it shows a proactive approach toward mitigation through strategic investments and operational excellence. The company&rsquo;s commitment to sustainability and its strong ESG initiatives are noteworthy.  The future prospects appear positive, fueled by a strong order book, capacity expansion, and a focused strategy for growth and innovation.  However, sustained focus on mitigating the identi/fied risks, especially those related to regulatory scrutiny and the success of its diversi/fication into semiconductors, will be important in achieving long-term sustainability.</p>

<p>The values for total assets, current assets, cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and inventory are presented differently in the Standalone and Consolidated financial statements.  Here&rsquo;s a breakdown from both:</p>
<p><strong>Standalone Financial Statements (as of March 31, 2024):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Total Assets:</strong> ₹4,253.98 crore</li>
<li><strong>Current Assets:</strong> ₹2,581.95 crore</li>
<li><strong>Cash and Cash Equivalents:</strong> ₹138.25 crore</li>
<li><strong>Accounts Receivable (Trade Receivables):</strong> ₹1,463.88 crore</li>
<li><strong>Inventory:</strong> ₹689.62 crore</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Consolidated Financial Statements (as of March 31, 2024):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Total Assets:</strong> ₹5,625.74 crore</li>
<li><strong>Current Assets:</strong> ₹2,477.53 crore</li>
<li><strong>Cash and Cash Equivalents:</strong> ₹199.84 crore</li>
<li><strong>Accounts Receivable (Trade Receivables):</strong> ₹1,534.19 crore</li>
<li><strong>Inventory:</strong> ₹750.71 crore</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Note:</strong> These figures are in Indian Rupees (₹) and rounded to the nearest crore (ten million).  The Consolidated figures include the assets and liabilities of all subsidiaries, while the Standalone figures reflect only CG Power&rsquo;s own operations.  There are also differences in how the &ldquo;Other financial assets&rdquo; and other current assets are categorized between the two statements. Therefore, comparing these values directly without considering the nuances of the consolidation is not advisable.</p>
<h3 class="heading" id="liability-analysis">
  Liability Analysis
  <a class="anchor" href="#liability-analysis">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Similar to the assets, the liabilities are presented differently in the standalone and consolidated financial statements. Here&rsquo;s a breakdown:</p>
<p><strong>Standalone Financial Statements (as of March 31, 2024):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Total Liabilities:</strong> ₹3,248.25 crore  (Note that this is calculated by subtracting equity from total assets: 4253.98 - 1005.73 = 3248.25)</li>
<li><strong>Current Liabilities:</strong> ₹1,456.84 crore</li>
<li><strong>Long-Term Debt:</strong> ₹2.81 crore (This is calculated from the non-current liabilities section of the balance sheet)</li>
<li><strong>Accounts Payable (Trade Payables):</strong> ₹1,352.13 crore (Note that this is only for creditors other than micro and small enterprises.  Micro and small enterprises account payables are reported separately.)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Consolidated Financial Statements (as of March 31, 2024):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Total Liabilities:</strong> ₹2,606.97 crore (This is calculated by subtracting equity and non-controlling interest from total assets: 5625.74 - 3017.44 - 1.33 = 2606.97)</li>
<li><strong>Current Liabilities:</strong> ₹1,858.43 crore (This figure appears to encompass various current financial liabilities and other current liabilities)</li>
<li><strong>Long-Term Debt:</strong> ₹10.96 crore (This is calculated from the non-current liabilities section of the balance sheet)</li>
<li><strong>Accounts Payable (Trade Payables):</strong> ₹1,379.38 crore (Note that this is only for creditors other than micro and small enterprises. Micro and small enterprises account payables are reported separately.)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Notes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>All figures are in Indian Rupees (₹) and rounded to the nearest crore.</li>
<li>The Consolidated figures represent the combined liabilities of CG Power and all its subsidiaries, while the Standalone figures pertain only to CG Power itself.</li>
<li>There are differences in the way certain liabilities are categorized and reported between the Standalone and Consolidated statements.  Direct comparison without understanding these differences should be avoided.  For example, the Standalone statement separately reports accounts payable to micro and small enterprises.</li>
</ul>
<p>It&rsquo;s essential to consult the detailed notes to the financial statements within the annual report for a complete understanding of the liability composition.</p>
<h3 class="heading" id="equity-analysis">
  Equity Analysis
  <a class="anchor" href="#equity-analysis">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Shareholders&rsquo; equity, retained earnings, and share capital values are also reported differently in the standalone and consolidated financial statements. Here&rsquo;s a breakdown:</p>
<p><strong>Standalone Financial Statements (as of March 31, 2024):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shareholders&rsquo; Equity:</strong> ₹1,005.73 crore (This is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from total assets: 4253.98 - 3248.25 = 1005.73)</li>
<li><strong>Retained Earnings:</strong> ₹1,096.59 crore</li>
<li><strong>Share Capital:</strong> ₹305.47 crore</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Consolidated Financial Statements (as of March 31, 2024):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shareholders&rsquo; Equity:</strong> ₹3,017.44 crore (This is calculated by subtracting total liabilities and non-controlling interest from total assets: 5625.74 - 2606.97 - 1.33 = 3017.44)</li>
<li><strong>Retained Earnings:</strong> ₹909.43 crore</li>
<li><strong>Share Capital:</strong> ₹305.47 crore</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Notes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>All figures are in Indian Rupees (₹) and rounded to the nearest crore.</li>
<li>The Consolidated shareholders&rsquo; equity includes the equity of all subsidiaries, while the Standalone figure represents only CG Power&rsquo;s equity.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Other Equity&rdquo; in the Statement of Changes in Equity provides a detailed breakdown of the components of shareholders&rsquo; equity beyond share capital.  Retained earnings are a significant component of this.  The values presented above for retained earnings are taken from the Statement of Changes in Equity, where the figures are explicitly stated.</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember to always refer to the detailed notes within the annual report for a complete and nuanced understanding of the financial data.</p>

<p>The revenue, cost of revenue, gross profit, operating expenses, and operating income figures differ between the standalone and consolidated financial statements. Here&rsquo;s a breakdown for both:</p>
<p><strong>Standalone Financial Statements (for the year ended March 31, 2024):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Revenue:</strong> ₹7,610 crore</li>
<li><strong>Cost of Revenue:</strong> ₹5,330 crore (This includes cost of materials consumed, purchases of stock-in-trade, and adjustments for changes in inventories)</li>
<li><strong>Gross Profit:</strong> ₹2,280 crore (Revenue - Cost of Revenue: 7610 - 5330 = 2280)</li>
<li><strong>Operating Expenses:</strong> ₹1,076 crore (This comprises employee benefits expense, depreciation and amortization expense, and other expenses.  Finance costs are <em>not</em> included in operating expenses according to Indian accounting standards.)</li>
<li><strong>Operating Income:</strong> ₹1,204 crore (Gross Profit - Operating Expenses: 2280 - 1076 = 1204)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Consolidated Financial Statements (for the year ended March 31, 2024):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Revenue:</strong> ₹8,046 crore</li>
<li><strong>Cost of Revenue:</strong> ₹5,552 crore (This includes cost of materials consumed, purchases of stock-in-trade, and adjustments for changes in inventories)</li>
<li><strong>Gross Profit:</strong> ₹2,494 crore (Revenue - Cost of Revenue: 8046 - 5552 = 2494)</li>
<li><strong>Operating Expenses:</strong> ₹1,234 crore (This comprises employee benefits expense, depreciation and amortization expense, and other expenses. Finance costs are <em>not</em> included in operating expenses according to Indian accounting standards.)</li>
<li><strong>Operating Income:</strong> ₹1,260 crore (Gross Profit - Operating Expenses: 2494 - 1234 = 1260)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Considerations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>All values are in Indian Rupees (₹) and rounded to the nearest crore.</li>
<li>The consolidated figures include the results of all subsidiaries, while standalone figures represent only CG Power&rsquo;s own operations.</li>
<li>The exact calculation of &ldquo;Cost of Revenue&rdquo; and &ldquo;Operating Expenses&rdquo; may vary slightly based on how specific line items are categorized in the annual report&rsquo;s notes to the financial statements.  The figures above represent the most straightforward interpretation of the provided data.</li>
</ul>
<p>It&rsquo;s always recommended to consult the complete annual report, including the detailed notes to the financial statements, for a precise understanding.</p>

<p>Again, we need to differentiate between the standalone and consolidated figures:</p>
<p><strong>Standalone Financial Statements (for the year ended March 31, 2024):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Net Income (Profit for the year):</strong> ₹1,004 crore</li>
<li><strong>EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization):</strong> ₹1,227 crore  (Note that &ldquo;Other Income&rdquo; is <em>included</em> in this EBITDA calculation.)</li>
<li><strong>Basic EPS (Earnings Per Share):</strong> ₹6.58</li>
<li><strong>Diluted EPS:</strong> ₹6.57</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Consolidated Financial Statements (for the year ended March 31, 2024):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Net Income (Profit for the year):</strong> ₹1,427 crore</li>
<li><strong>EBITDA:</strong> ₹1,234 crore (Note that &ldquo;Other Income&rdquo; is <em>included</em> in this EBITDA calculation.)</li>
<li><strong>Basic EPS (for continuing operations):</strong> ₹5.70</li>
<li><strong>Diluted EPS (for continuing operations):</strong> ₹5.69</li>
<li><strong>Basic EPS (for discontinued operations):</strong> ₹3.64</li>
<li><strong>Diluted EPS (for discontinued operations):</strong> ₹3.64</li>
<li><strong>Basic EPS (total operations):</strong> ₹9.34</li>
<li><strong>Diluted EPS (total operations):</strong> ₹9.33</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Notes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>All values are in Indian Rupees (₹) unless otherwise specified.</li>
<li>The consolidated figures incorporate the results of all subsidiaries, whereas the standalone figures reflect only CG Power&rsquo;s direct operations.</li>
<li>The consolidated statement provides separate EPS figures for continuing and discontinued operations and then a combined figure for total operations.  The standalone statement reports only total operations.</li>
<li>The EBITDA figure includes &ldquo;Other Income,&rdquo; which is a non-operating item.  A more precise measure of operating pro/fitability might exclude this income.  The report also presents EBITDA <em>excluding</em> other income.</li>

  Cash Flow Components
  <a class="anchor" href="#cash-flow-components">#</a>
</h3>
<p>The operating, investing, and financing cash flows are also reported differently in the standalone and consolidated statements. Here&rsquo;s the data:</p>
<p><strong>Standalone Statement of Cash Flows (for the year ended March 31, 2024):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cash Flow from Operating Activities:</strong> ₹331.95 crore</li>
<li><strong>Cash Flow from Investing Activities:</strong> ₹(584.04) crore  (Negative indicates net cash outflow)</li>
<li><strong>Cash Flow from Financing Activities:</strong> ₹(243.21) crore (Negative indicates net cash outflow)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows (for the year ended March 31, 2024):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cash Flow from Operating Activities (Continuing):</strong> ₹403.26 crore</li>
<li><strong>Cash Flow from Operating Activities (Discontinued):</strong> ₹(6.27) crore</li>
<li><strong>Cash Flow from Investing Activities (Continuing):</strong> ₹(662.17) crore (Negative indicates net cash outflow)</li>
<li><strong>Cash Flow from Investing Activities (Discontinued):</strong> ₹83.20 crore</li>
<li><strong>Cash Flow from Financing Activities (Continuing):</strong> ₹(246.33) crore (Negative indicates net cash outflow)</li>
<li><strong>Cash Flow from Financing Activities (Discontinued):</strong> ₹(0.64) crore (Negative indicates net cash outflow)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Considerations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>All figures are in Indian Rupees (₹) and rounded to the nearest crore.</li>
<li>Negative values indicate a net cash <em>outflow</em> for that activity.</li>
<li>The consolidated statement presents cash flows separately for continuing and discontinued operations.  The standalone statement only shows total cash flow for each activity.</li>
</ul>
<p>For complete details, including a breakdown of the individual components within each cash flow category, refer to the detailed notes within the annual report&rsquo;s Statement of Cash Flows.  The report provides further breakdowns of the cash flow numbers.</p>

  Cash Flow Metrics
  <a class="anchor" href="#cash-flow-metrics">#</a>
</h3>
<p>The annual report doesn&rsquo;t explicitly state a single &ldquo;free cash flow&rdquo; figure.  However, we can calculate it using the information provided in the Statement of Cash Flows and other notes.  It is also important to note the difference between standalone and consolidated figures.</p>
<p><strong>Standalone:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Capital Expenditure (CAPEX):</strong>  The report states CAPEX of ₹220 crore for capacity expansion projects during FY24. This is a direct figure from the report.  However, the Statement of Cash Flows shows purchase of property, plant and equipment of ₹195.47 crore. The difference could be due to timing differences between expenditure and cash outflow.</li>
<li><strong>Dividends Paid:</strong> ₹198.55 crore was paid as an interim dividend in FY24.  There was no final dividend recommended.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Consolidated:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Capital Expenditure (CAPEX):</strong> The consolidated Statement of Cash Flows lists a total cash outflow for the purchase of property, plant, and equipment (including capital work-in-progress and capital advances) of ₹234.27 crore.  This likely includes the CAPEX of subsidiaries as well.</li>
<li><strong>Dividends Paid:</strong> ₹198.55 crore was paid as an interim dividend in FY24 by the parent company.  The consolidated financial statements do not explicitly state the total dividends paid by the entire group.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Free Cash Flow (Estimate):</strong></p>
<p>Free cash flow is typically calculated as:</p>
<p>Free Cash Flow = Cash Flow from Operations - Capital Expenditures</p>
<p>Using the <em>standalone</em> cash flow figures as a rough estimate:</p>
<p>Free Cash Flow (Standalone, estimate) = ₹331.95 crore - ₹195.47 crore = ₹136.48 crore</p>
<p>Using the <em>consolidated</em> cash flow figures as a rough estimate:</p>
<p>Free Cash Flow (Consolidated, estimate) = ₹403.26 crore (Continuing) + ₹(-6.27 crore) (Discontinued) - ₹234.27 crore (Continuing) + ₹83.20 crore (Discontinued)= ₹145.92 crore</p>
<p><strong>Important Notes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>These free cash flow calculations are estimates based on the most readily available data.  A more precise calculation would require a deeper analysis of the cash flow statement, potentially adjusting for changes in working capital and other factors.</li>
<li>The consolidated free cash flow is an estimate of the total free cash flow generated by the entire group and considers cash flow from discontinued operations as well.</li>
<li>The report does not provide any adjustment of non-cash items, which could affect this calculation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Always consult the complete annual report and its notes for the most accurate and detailed information.  The actual free cash flow number could vary depending on the precise methodology used for calculation.</p>

<p>The annual report provides profitability ratios, but it&rsquo;s essential to distinguish between standalone and consolidated figures.  Also, note that the calculation of certain ratios might differ slightly depending on the precise figures used from the financial statements.  The following uses figures from the main financial statements, but a more precise answer might require accessing the data in greater detail from the report.</p>
<p><strong>Standalone Financial Statements (for the year ended March 31, 2024):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Gross Profit Margin:</strong> (Gross Profit / Revenue) = (₹2,280 crore / ₹7,610 crore) = 30%</li>
<li><strong>Operating Profit Margin:</strong> (Operating Income / Revenue) = (₹1,204 crore / ₹7,610 crore) = 16%</li>
<li><strong>Net Profit Margin:</strong> (Net Income / Revenue) = (₹1,004 crore / ₹7,610 crore) = 13%</li>
<li><strong>Return on Equity (ROE):</strong> (Net Income / Average Shareholders&rsquo; Equity) = (₹1,004 crore / [(₹979 crore + ₹2,125 crore)/2]) = 31%</li>
<li><strong>Return on Assets (ROA):</strong> (Net Income / Average Total Assets) = (₹1,004 crore / [(₹4,275 crore + ₹3,931 crore)/2]) = 12%</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Consolidated Financial Statements (for the year ended March 31, 2024):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Gross Profit Margin:</strong> (Gross Profit / Revenue) = (₹2,494 crore / ₹8,046 crore) = 31%</li>
<li><strong>Operating Profit Margin:</strong> (Operating Income / Revenue) = (₹1,260 crore / ₹8,046 crore) = 16%</li>
<li><strong>Net Profit Margin:</strong> (Net Income / Revenue) = (₹1,427 crore / ₹8,046 crore) = 18%</li>
<li><strong>Return on Equity (ROE):</strong> (Net Income / Average Shareholders&rsquo; Equity) = (₹1,427 crore / [(₹1,485 crore +₹2,940 crore)/2]) = 46%</li>
<li><strong>Return on Assets (ROA):</strong> (Net Income / Average Total Assets) = (₹1,427 crore / [(₹4,669 crore +₹5,474 crore)/2]) = 15%</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Notes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>All values are approximate and in percentage terms.</li>
<li>The consolidated figures represent the entire group&rsquo;s performance, while the standalone figures are for CG Power alone.</li>
<li>Average shareholders&rsquo; equity and average total assets were calculated using the beginning and ending balances from the balance sheet.  More precise calculations might utilize a different averaging method.  Also, the net income for the ROE and ROA calculation is before minority interest.</li>
<li>The reported net income for the ROE and ROA calculations differs from net income stated in the profit and loss statement due to the impact of minority interests.</li>
</ul>
<p>Always cross-reference these figures with the complete annual report, especially the notes to the financial statements, for the most accurate results.  The report itself may offer slightly different calculations or additional ratios.</p>

  Liquidity Ratios
  <a class="anchor" href="#liquidity-ratios">#</a>
</h3>
<p>The annual report provides some liquidity ratios, but, as with other metrics, we must differentiate between standalone and consolidated figures.  Also, the calculation may vary slightly depending on which specific figures are used from the financial statements.  The following calculations are based on the main figures from the balance sheet.</p>
<p><strong>Standalone Financial Statements (as of March 31, 2024):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Current Ratio:</strong> (Current Assets / Current Liabilities) = (₹2,581.95 crore / ₹1,456.84 crore) = 1.8</li>
<li><strong>Quick Ratio:</strong> (Current Assets - Inventories) / Current Liabilities = (₹2,581.95 crore - ₹689.62 crore) / ₹1,456.84 crore = 1.3</li>
<li><strong>Cash Ratio:</strong> (Cash and Cash Equivalents / Current Liabilities) = (₹138.25 crore / ₹1,456.84 crore) = 0.1</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Consolidated Financial Statements (as of March 31, 2024):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Current Ratio:</strong> (Current Assets / Current Liabilities) = (₹2,477.53 crore / ₹1,858.43 crore) = 1.3</li>
<li><strong>Quick Ratio:</strong> (Current Assets - Inventories) / Current Liabilities = (₹2,477.53 crore - ₹750.71 crore) / ₹1,858.43 crore = 0.9</li>
<li><strong>Cash Ratio:</strong> (Cash and Cash Equivalents / Current Liabilities) = (₹199.84 crore / ₹1,858.43 crore) = 0.1</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Notes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>All values are approximate and in ratio terms (e.g., 1.8:1).</li>
<li>The consolidated ratios reflect the liquidity position of the entire group, including all subsidiaries, while standalone ratios are for CG Power only.</li>
<li>The calculation of the current ratio is simple, but the quick ratio and cash ratio may have slightly different results based on how the specific line items (current assets, inventories, cash and cash equivalents, and current liabilities) are categorized and included in the balance sheet.  The detailed breakdown is present in the notes accompanying the statements and there could be minor differences in line items included depending on the level of detail.</li>

<p>The annual report doesn&rsquo;t directly provide all of these efficiency ratios. We can estimate some, but precise calculation would require more detailed information from the notes to the financial statements, especially regarding the average values used in the calculation.  Again, we must distinguish between standalone and consolidated figures.  Here are the estimates:</p>
<p><strong>Standalone Financial Statements (for the year ended March 31, 2024):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Asset Turnover:</strong> (Revenue / Average Total Assets) = (₹7,610 crore / [(₹3,931 crore + ₹4,275 crore)/2]) = 1.8 times</li>
<li><strong>Inventory Turnover:</strong> (Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory) = (₹5,330 crore / [(₹490 crore + ₹690 crore)/2]) = 10.7 times</li>
<li><strong>Receivables Turnover:</strong> (Revenue / Average Accounts Receivable) = (₹7,610 crore / [(₹1,230 crore + ₹1,464 crore)/2]) = 5.1 times</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Consolidated Financial Statements (for the year ended March 31, 2024):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Asset Turnover:</strong> (Revenue / Average Total Assets) = (₹8,046 crore / [(₹4,669 crore + ₹5,474 crore)/2]) = 1.5 times</li>
<li><strong>Inventory Turnover:</strong> (Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory) = (₹5,552 crore / [(₹541 crore + ₹751 crore)/2]) = 8.9 times</li>
<li><strong>Receivables Turnover:</strong> (Revenue / Average Accounts Receivable) = (₹8,046 crore / [(₹1,297 crore + ₹1,534 crore)/2]) = 5.1 times</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Notes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>These are estimates.  Accurate calculations require the average values for total assets, inventory, and accounts receivable over the reporting period. These averages are not explicitly given in the provided extracts but are present in the full report.</li>
<li>The standalone figures pertain to CG Power&rsquo;s individual performance, while consolidated figures include its subsidiaries.</li>

<p>Again, we need to distinguish between standalone and consolidated use ratios and remember that slight variations in calculation are possible depending on the specific data points used from the financial statements.</p>
<p><strong>Standalone Financial Statements (as of March 31, 2024):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Debt-to-Equity Ratio:</strong> (Total Debt / Shareholders&rsquo; Equity) = (₹2.81 crore / ₹1,005.73 crore) = 0.003  (Essentially 0.3%)</li>

<li><strong>Interest Coverage Ratio:</strong> (Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT) / Interest Expense) = (₹1,146 crore + ₹2.68 crore / ₹2.68 crore) = 429 times (This calculation uses the PBT before exceptional items + Finance cost as a proxy for EBIT. A more precise calculation would require extracting EBIT directly from the report.)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Consolidated Financial Statements (as of March 31, 2024):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Debt-to-Equity Ratio:</strong> (Total Debt / Shareholders&rsquo; Equity) = (₹0.12 crore / ₹3,017.44 crore) =  0.00004 (Essentially 0.004%)</li>
<li><strong>Debt-to-Assets Ratio:</strong> (Total Debt / Total Assets) = (₹0.12 crore / ₹5,625.74 crore) = 0.00002 (Essentially 0.002%)</li>
<li><strong>Interest Coverage Ratio:</strong> (Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT) / Interest Expense) = (₹1,137 crore +₹2.54 crore / ₹2.54 crore) = 449 times (This calculation uses the PBT before exceptional items + Finance cost as a proxy for EBIT.  A more precise calculation would require extracting EBIT directly from the report.)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Notes:</strong></p>

<li>All values are approximate and expressed as ratios or percentages.</li>
<li>The standalone ratios reflect only CG Power&rsquo;s leverage, while the consolidated ratios encompass the entire group, including subsidiaries.</li>

<p>The annual report provides some of this information, but not all.  We&rsquo;ll need to make some calculations and note that accuracy depends on the data used and the specific methods of calculation.  Also, market-based ratios (market cap, PE, PB) are highly dynamic and will change constantly depending on the current market price of the stock.  The values given below are based on data present in the report and are therefore retrospective values.</p>
<p><strong>As of March 31, 2024 (Retrospective Values):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Market Capitalization:</strong> To calculate this, we need the closing share price on March 31st, 2024, and the total number of outstanding shares.  The report provides the number of outstanding shares (152,73,33,214).  However, it does <em>not</em> give the closing share price for March 31st, 2024, only high and low prices for that month.  Therefore, the market cap can&rsquo;t be precisely calculated without that missing information from the complete report.</li>
<li><strong>Price-to-Earnings Ratio (PE Ratio):</strong>  This requires the market price per share and the earnings per share (EPS). Similar to market cap, we lack the precise closing share price on March 31st, 2024, making a precise calculation impossible. The report provides the EPS as ₹6.58 (standalone) and ₹9.34 (consolidated), which are calculated from the profit and loss. However, these values are based on the <em>annual</em> pro/fit and, therefore, may not be comparable to the use of a daily closing price.</li>
<li><strong>Price-to-Book Ratio (PB Ratio):</strong>  Requires the market price per share and the book value per share. The report gives the book value per share (Net Assets Employed), but again, we lack the precise closing share price needed for a precise calculation.</li>
<li><strong>Dividend Yield:</strong> (Annual Dividend per Share / Market Price per Share) x 100.  We only have the <em>interim</em> dividend of ₹1.30 per share. To calculate the annual dividend yield we would need the final dividend (not recommended), annualized interim dividend or the market price on a relevant date. The report doesn&rsquo;t provide this information for an accurate calculation.</li>
<li><strong>Dividend Payout Ratio:</strong> (Dividends Paid / Net Income). For the standalone report the interim dividend was ₹198.55 crore and the Net income ₹1004.36 crore. Therefore, the payout ratio = (198.55 / 1004.36) = 20%.  For the consolidated report we&rsquo;d need the total dividends paid by the entire group to calculate the consolidated payout ratio.  The report does not provide enough information to calculate a meaningful consolidated dividend payout ratio.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>In summary:</strong>  While the annual report provides the necessary components to calculate these ratios, the missing closing share price for March 31st, 2024, and the lack of a final dividend declaration prevents the precise calculation of market cap, PE ratio, PB ratio, and a definitive dividend yield.  The dividend payout ratio is only calculated for the standalone version using the interim dividend.  To obtain these values, one would need to consult a live financial data source and use the current market price of CG Power&rsquo;s stock.</p>
