</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Severity:</strong> High. Significant shifts in the financial services industry, driven by technological advancements and changing customer expectations, pose a severe threat to market share and long-term growth.</li>
<li><strong>Likelihood:</strong> High. The pace of technological change and evolving competitive landscape make this risk highly probable.</li>
<li><strong>Trend:</strong> Increasing. The growing adoption of cloud-based solutions, AI, and componentized architectures is accelerating, intensifying the risk.</li>
<li><strong>Mitigation Strategies:</strong> Continuous investment in R&amp;D for next-generation, cloud-native solutions; strategic partnerships with fintech companies; componentized architecture and an API-first ecosystem.</li>
<li><strong>Control Effectiveness:</strong> Partially Effective. R&amp;D investment shows a commitment to adapting, but the rapid pace of change challenges complete control. $137M of license win can show the return of previous investments.</li>
<li><strong>Potential Financial Impact:</strong> Revenue growth could be hindered if adaptation is slow, impacting profitability and market capitalization. The disclosed 12% consolidated revenue increase and 23% net profit increase may be at risk if strategic adaptation fails.</li>

<li><strong>Severity:</strong> Medium to High. Risks include project delivery failures, human resource constraints, cybersecurity, and potential disruptions from geopolitical events or pandemics.</li>
<li><strong>Likelihood:</strong> Medium. The global nature of operations increases exposure to various operational disruptions.</li>
<li><strong>Trend:</strong> Stable to Increasing. Cybersecurity threats and human resource constraints (talent acquisition and retention) are likely to increase.</li>
<li><strong>Mitigation Strategies:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Human Resources:</strong> Responsive compensation, positive work environment, employee engagement tools, accelerated hiring process.</li>
<li><strong>Cybersecurity:</strong> Investments in security tools and technologies, including encryption, access management, and data protection.</li>
<li><strong>Customer Contract Delivery:</strong> Standardized contracts with deviations needing approval, active monitoring of project health.</li>
<li><strong>Geographical Spread:</strong> Leveraging a global footprint as a natural hedge against regional economic downturns.</li>
<li><strong>Pandemic Uncertainties</strong>: Robust IT,data security infrastructure, and business continuity processes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Control Effectiveness:</strong> Mixed. While mitigation strategies are in place, their effectiveness varies. For instance, employee costs increased by 8%, indicating potential challenges in talent retention, despite efforts.</li>
<li><strong>Potential Financial Impact:</strong> Increased operating expenses, project delays, and potential revenue loss, evidenced by the 33% increase in travel-related expenses,26% in professional fees and 47% in &ldquo;Other expenses&rdquo; (FY 2024 vs. FY 2023, consolidated).</li>

<li><strong>Trend:</strong> Stable. The Company&rsquo;s financial reporting shows ongoing fluctuations in finance income and expenses.</li>
<li><strong>Mitigation Strategies:</strong> Hedging of trade receivables in major currencies using forward contracts.</li>
<li><strong>Control Effectiveness:</strong> Partially Effective. Hedging activities help mitigate volatility, but cannot eliminate all risk. &ldquo;Finance income and other income, net&rdquo; changed from â¹1,918.43 million (FY 2023) to â¹3,421.92 million (FY 2024, consolidated), showcasing continued exposure.</li>
