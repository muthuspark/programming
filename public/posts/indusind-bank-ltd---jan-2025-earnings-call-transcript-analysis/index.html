Explained the approach to managing lending to customers with multiple lenders. Reiterated commitment to reducing bulk deposits. Provided segment-specific insights on asset quality trends and outlook. Offered a perspective on MFI industry growth, suggesting moderation to 10-15%. Evasions/Indirect Answers # Declined to provide specific guidance on margins. Did not share business-wise provision details. Did not provide a specific answer on the mix of open market sourcing in credit cards. New Information # Specific utilization of contingency buffer (₹160 crores for MFI, ₹40 crores for a corporate account).

  Key Takeaways
  <a class="anchor" href="#key-takeaways">#</a>
</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Microfinance Remains a Key Focus:</strong> The microfinance segment is clearly the most significant area of concern, with elevated slippages and uncertainty surrounding regulatory changes. Management is taking a cautious approach, prioritizing stability and existing customers over aggressive growth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Retail Growth and Diversification:</strong> The bank is making progress in diversifying its loan book and strengthening its retail franchise. Growth in retail deposits, other retail assets, and the scaling of new initiatives like home loans are positive signs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Margin Pressure:</strong> NIM compression is a concern, driven by microfinance stress and EBLR repricing. Management is hesitant to provide specific guidance, highlighting the need to wait and watch how the microfinance situation and interest rate environment evolve.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Asset Quality Watchfulness:</strong> While microfinance is the primary concern, management is also closely monitoring asset quality in other segments, particularly tractors, SCVs, and credit cards.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Digital Transformation Continues:</strong> The bank continues to invest in digital initiatives, with the rollout of INDIE to all customers and the launch of INDIE for Business being key highlights.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cautious but Resilient:</strong> Overall, the bank is navigating a challenging environment with a cautious but resilient approach. Management is focused on managing risks, strengthening the balance sheet, and positioning the bank for long-term growth. The next few quarters will be crucial in determining the trajectory of the microfinance portfolio and the overall impact on the bank&rsquo;s financial performance.</p>
