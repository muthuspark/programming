<p>This analysis examines Lloyds Engineering Works Limited&rsquo;s (LEWL) annual report for the fiscal year 2023-24, focusing on financial performance, business segments, identified risks, and ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) initiatives.</p>
<p><strong>I. Financial Performance:</strong></p>
<p>LEWL experienced dramatic growth in FY24, a sharp turnaround from previous years. Key highlights include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Significant Revenue Growth:</strong>  Revenue from operations surged by 99.69% year-on-year (YoY) to ₹6,242.36 Lakhs (₹624.24 Crore), compared to ₹3,126.09 Lakhs (₹312.61 Crore) in FY23.  This represents a massive increase compared to the loss in FY22.</li>
<li><strong>Profitability Improvement:</strong>  Profit After Tax (PAT) jumped by 116.82% YoY to ₹7,983.83 Lakhs (₹798.38 Crore), exceeding the FY22 turnover. Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (EBITDA) increased by 86.82% to ₹10,843.69 Lakhs (₹1,084.37 Crore).</li>
<li><strong>High Margins:</strong>  EBITDA margin was 17.17%, slightly lower than the previous year&rsquo;s 18.23%, but still high compared to industry averages. PAT margin was 12.64%.</li>
<li><strong>Strong Order Book:</strong> The order book increased significantly to ₹90,431.95 Lakhs (₹904.32 Crore), providing strong revenue visibility for the next 12-15 months.  This represents a 32.42% YoY growth.</li>
<li><strong>Debt-Free Balance Sheet:</strong> The company is debt-free, indicating strong financial health and stability.  Its net worth was ₹41,119.81 Lakhs (₹411.20 Crore) as of March 31, 2024.</li>
<li><strong>High Return on Equity (ROE):</strong> ROE was a remarkable 26.32%, reflecting efficient capital utilization.  Return on Capital Employed (ROCE) was 22.12%.</li>
<li><strong>Asset Turnover:</strong>  The company generated ₹8.11 for every rupee invested in gross block, indicating efficient asset utilization.</li>
<li><strong>Working Capital Management:</strong>  The company improved working capital management, reducing the working capital tenure and enhancing turnover.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>II. Business Segments:</strong></p>
<p>LEWL operates in many niche engineering segments, each contributing to the overall growth:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Steel Sector:</strong> LEWL supplies equipment for steel plants, including iron ore processing, iron making, steel making, casting, and rolling.  This segment benefits from India&rsquo;s growing steel production capacity.  The company also highlights its entry into the eco-pickling technology (acid-free steel pickling), a sustainable and potentially high-growth area.</li>
<li><strong>Boilers:</strong> The boiler segment experienced a near doubling of the order book.  They supply AFBC and CFBC boilers, focusing on energy efficiency and catering to the steel, hydrocarbon, and other industries.</li>
<li><strong>Hydrocarbons:</strong>  LEWL supplies process equipment and static equipment to the oil and gas industry, leveraging decades of experience and strong client relationships.</li>
<li><strong>Marine/Defense:</strong>  This segment focuses on specialized equipment for the Indian Navy, such as electro-hydraulic steering gear and fin stabilizers.  Growth is expected due to the Navy&rsquo;s planned fleet expansion.</li>
<li><strong>Theme-Based Construction:</strong> This relatively new segment focuses on aesthetically pleasing and functional urban infrastructure projects, showcasing completed projects in Mumbai.</li>
<li><strong>Material Transfers:</strong>  The company manufactures electro-hydraulic systems for loading and unloading arms in ports, aiming to capitalize on the increasing demand for clean fuels and port infrastructure development.  They highlight a technology alliance with TBG Niigata (Japan) to increase indigenization.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>III. Risks and Concerns:</strong></p>
<p>The annual report highlights many key risks:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Competition:</strong> The engineering industry is competitive, impacting margins.  LEWL&rsquo;s strategy of focusing on customized solutions in niche markets aims to mitigate this.</li>
<li><strong>Raw Material Price Fluctuations:</strong>  Fluctuations in raw material costs pose a risk. LEWL mitigates this by strategic sourcing, forward buying using cash on hand, and exploring technology alliances to indigenize production.</li>
<li><strong>Talent Acquisition and Retention:</strong>  Finding skilled labor is a challenge, especially with India&rsquo;s growing infrastructure development.  LEWL is investing in employee training and retention strategies, including ESOPs.</li>
<li><strong>Economic Slowdown:</strong> A global or domestic economic slowdown could negatively impact demand.</li>
<li><strong>Regulatory Changes:</strong> Changes in government regulations, tax regimes, and environmental compliance requirements pose risks.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>IV. ESG Initiatives:</strong></p>
<p>LEWL&rsquo;s ESG focus is evident throughout the report:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Eco-Pickling Technology:</strong>  A major step towards environmental responsibility. This technology replaces traditional acid-based pickling, reducing environmental impact and offering cost advantages.</li>
<li><strong>Technology Alliances:</strong> Partnerships with Japanese (TBG Niigata) and US (The Material Works Limited) companies demonstrate a commitment to technological advancement and sustainability.</li>
<li><strong>Energy Conservation:</strong>  The company aims to reduce energy intensity and increase the use of renewable energy.</li>
<li><strong>CSR Activities:</strong>  LEWL&rsquo;s CSR initiatives focus on providing meals to the needy through NGOs.</li>
<li><strong>Employee Well-being:</strong>  Emphasis on employee training, health insurance, accident insurance, and work-life balance initiatives.</li>
<li><strong>Human Rights:</strong>  The company claims to have training programs on human rights and policies extending to its value chain.</li>
<li><strong>Health and Safety:</strong>  Implementation of ISO 45001:2018 standards for occupational health and safety.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>V. Overall Assessment:</strong></p>
<p>LEWL&rsquo;s FY24 annual report showcases remarkable financial growth and a clear strategic shift towards customized, high-margin engineering solutions in niche markets. The company is capitalizing on India&rsquo;s infrastructure development boom while proactively addressing ESG concerns and mitigating potential risks.  However, the reliance on a few key segments and the potential impact of global economic uncertainties warrants close monitoring. The ambitious growth targets and expansion plans need to be carefully executed to ensure long-term sustainable success.  The significant improvement in key financial ratios is a positive indication. The company&rsquo;s debt-free status provides a strong foundation for continued growth, but vigilance regarding raw material prices and labor availability is essential.  Their proactive ESG commitments represent a clear step towards creating a more responsible and sustainable business.</p>

<p>Based on Lloyds Engineering Works Limited&rsquo;s (LEWL) 2023-24 annual report:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Total Assets:</strong> ₹57,127.82 Lakhs (₹571.28 Crore)</li>
<li><strong>Current Assets:</strong> ₹57,127.82 Lakhs (₹571.28 Crore)  (Note:  The report appears to have an error here.  Current assets should be less than total assets.  The non-current assets are separately listed.)</li>
<li><strong>Cash and Cash Equivalents:</strong> ₹12,497.13 Lakhs (₹124.97 Crore)</li>
<li><strong>Accounts Receivable (Trade Receivables):</strong> ₹15,181.07 Lakhs (₹151.81 Crore)</li>
<li><strong>Inventory:</strong> ₹10,198.30 Lakhs (₹101.98 Crore)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Note:</strong> There&rsquo;s a clear discrepancy in the report where current assets are equal to total assets. This is an error in the financial statement presentation.  To obtain the correct Current Asset value, one would need to subtract the Non-Current Assets (₹12,300.19 Lakhs) from the Total Assets (₹57,127.82 Lakhs).  This gives a corrected Current Asset value of ₹44,827.63 Lakhs (₹448.28 Crore)</p>

<li><strong>Current Liabilities:</strong> ₹13,957.22 Lakhs (₹139.57 Crore)</li>
<li><strong>Long-Term Debt:</strong> ₹1,618.58 Lakhs (₹16.19 Crore) (This is calculated by summing the non-current portion of borrowings (₹465.27 Lakhs) and lease liabilities (₹1,178.31 Lakhs) from Note 18. )</li>
<li><strong>Accounts Payable (Trade Payables):</strong> ₹2,800.27 Lakhs (₹28.00 Crore)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Note:</strong>  The report does not explicitly separate long-term debt from current liabilities in the main balance sheet. The value for long-term debt is derived from the detail provided in Note 18 of the financial statements, which further breaks down the liabilities.</p>

<p><strong>Important Note:</strong>  The presentation of the Statement of Profit and Loss in the annual report doesn&rsquo;t strictly follow a standard format for calculating operating income.  Finance costs and depreciation are presented separately below the operating profit line.  The calculation above reflects the company&rsquo;s presentation rather than a strict GAAP definition of operating income.  A more standardized operating income calculation would include only operating revenues and expenses.</p>

<p>Based on Lloyds Engineering Works Limited&rsquo;s (LEWL) 2023-24 cash flow statement:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cash Flow from Operating Activities:</strong>  (₹4,498.28 Lakhs)  The negative value indicates a net cash outflow from operations.</li>
<li><strong>Cash Flow from Investing Activities:</strong> ₹9,674.95 Lakhs (positive, indicating net cash inflow from investing activities)</li>
<li><strong>Cash Flow from Financing Activities:</strong> ₹14,231.51 Lakhs (positive, indicating net cash inflow from financing activities)</li>

<p>Remember that these figures are presented in Lakhs of Indian Rupees.  The parentheses around the operating cash flow indicate a negative (outflow) value.</p>
<h3 class="heading" id="cash-flow-metrics">
  Cash Flow Metrics
  <a class="anchor" href="#cash-flow-metrics">#</a>
</h3>
<p>The provided annual report doesn&rsquo;t directly state the free cash flow.  Free cash flow (FCF) is calculated as operating cash flow less capital expenditures.  We can derive the other two figures:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Capital Expenditure:</strong> ₹5,082.53 Lakhs (₹50.83 Crore)  This is explicitly stated in the Cash Flow Statement under Investing Activities.</li>
<li><strong>Dividends Paid:</strong> ₹1,078.88 Lakhs (₹10.79 Crore) This is found in the Statement of Changes in Equity and also explicitly mentioned in the Directors&rsquo; Report.</li>
</ul>
<p>To calculate free cash flow (FCF), we would need the operating cash flow, which is presented as a net cash flow <em>from</em> operating activities.  However, the report shows a negative net cash flow from operations in the amount of ₹4,498.28 Lakhs.  Therefore, a straightforward calculation of free cash flow using the data provided results in a negative value, which is unusual and should be further investigated for accuracy and explanation.  It is possible there is a reporting difference between operating cash flow and free cash flow as presented in the financial statements.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s calculate the profitability ratios for Lloyds Engineering Works Limited (LEWL) for FY2023-24 using the figures from the annual report.  Remember that some calculations may vary slightly depending on the precise figures used and how operating income is defined (see previous responses for a discussion of this).  All figures are in Lakhs unless otherwise stated.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Revenue:</strong> ₹62,423.61</li>
<li><strong>Cost of Revenue:</strong> ₹37,000.24</li>
<li><strong>Gross Profit:</strong> ₹25,423.37</li>
<li><strong>Operating Expenses (Manufacturing and Other Expenses):</strong> ₹9,054.20</li>
<li><strong>Operating Income (EBIT):</strong> ₹16,369.17 (this uses the company&rsquo;s presentation of operating income; a stricter definition might exclude some items)</li>
<li><strong>Net Income (PAT):</strong> ₹7,983.83</li>
<li><strong>Shareholders&rsquo; Equity:</strong> ₹41,119.81</li>
<li><strong>Total Assets:</strong> ₹57,127.82</li>
</ul>
<p>The profitability ratios are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Gross Profit Margin:</strong> (Gross Profit / Revenue) * 100 = (25,423.37 / 62,423.61) * 100 = <strong>40.71%</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Operating Profit Margin (EBIT Margin):</strong> (Operating Income / Revenue) * 100 = (16,369.17 / 62,423.61) * 100 = <strong>26.23%</strong> (Note: this calculation uses the company&rsquo;s presentation of operating income)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Net Profit Margin:</strong> (Net Income / Revenue) * 100 = (7,983.83 / 62,423.61) * 100 = <strong>12.79%</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Return on Equity (ROE):</strong> (Net Income / Shareholders&rsquo; Equity) * 100 = (7,983.83 / 41,119.81) * 100 = <strong>19.41%</strong></p>

<li>
<p><strong>Return on Assets (ROA):</strong> (Net Income / Total Assets) * 100 = (7,983.83 / 57,127.82) * 100 = <strong>13.97%</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Considerations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Operating Income Definition:</strong>  The operating margin calculation above uses the company&rsquo;s reported operating income, which might differ slightly from a standardized calculation.  A more conservative approach might yield a different operating margin.</li>
<li><strong>Year-Over-Year Comparison:</strong>  For a more complete analysis, compare these ratios to LEWL&rsquo;s previous years&rsquo; performance and industry benchmarks.  The significant year-on-year growth makes direct comparison challenging, as the underlying economics are likely to change with scale.</li>
<li><strong>Accuracy of Data:</strong> The annual report itself contains an error in the presentation of total assets and current assets, which potentially undermines the accuracy of some calculations.  Verification of the data source and its correctness is required for further interpretation.</li>
</ul>
<p>These ratios provide a snapshot of LEWL&rsquo;s profitability.  A thorough analysis requires a deeper dive into the financial statements, industry comparisons, and an understanding of the company&rsquo;s strategic initiatives.</p>

  Liquidity Ratios
  <a class="anchor" href="#liquidity-ratios">#</a>
</h3>
<p>To calculate the liquidity ratios for Lloyds Engineering Works Limited (LEWL) for FY2023-24, we&rsquo;ll use the figures from the annual report.  Remember that there was an error in the report itself (current assets equaling total assets),  so we&rsquo;ll use the corrected current asset value calculated previously. All figures are in Lakhs unless otherwise stated.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Corrected Current Assets:</strong> ₹44,827.63</li>
<li><strong>Current Liabilities:</strong> ₹13,957.22</li>
<li><strong>Cash and Cash Equivalents:</strong> ₹12,497.13</li>
<li><strong>Accounts Receivable (Trade Receivables):</strong> ₹15,181.07</li>
<li><strong>Inventory:</strong> ₹10,198.30</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the liquidity ratios:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Current Ratio:</strong> Current Assets / Current Liabilities = 44,827.63 / 13,957.22 = <strong>3.21</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Quick Ratio (Acid-Test Ratio):</strong> (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities = (44,827.63 - 10,198.30) / 13,957.22 = <strong>2.48</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cash Ratio:</strong> (Cash and Cash Equivalents) / Current Liabilities = 12,497.13 / 13,957.22 = <strong>0.89</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Interpretation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Current Ratio (3.21):</strong>  This indicates that LEWL has 3.21 times more current assets than current liabilities. This is generally considered a healthy ratio, suggesting the company has a good ability to meet its short-term obligations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Quick Ratio (2.48):</strong>  The quick ratio, which excludes inventory from current assets, is also healthy, suggesting LEWL has sufficient liquid assets to cover its immediate liabilities.  This is important as inventory may not be quickly convertible to cash.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cash Ratio (0.89):</strong> The cash ratio, which only considers the most liquid assets (cash and cash equivalents), is below 1.  While this suggests that LEWL might not have enough readily available cash to cover all its current liabilities, this is not necessarily a negative indicator, especially given the company&rsquo;s strong overall financial position and substantial accounts receivable.  The cash ratio would need to be considered in the context of the collection cycle of the accounts receivable.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Note:</strong> These ratios are subject to the correction made to the current assets figure, due to the error in the annual report.  Additionally, these ratios should be compared to industry benchmarks and LEWL&rsquo;s historical performance for a more detailed analysis.  The current ratio, for example, shows strong liquidity, while the quick and cash ratios are more moderate which requires further investigation to assess its implication on liquidity. The company&rsquo;s large outstanding accounts receivables and strong overall financial position should be considered in order to make a conclusive assessment of liquidity and its implication.</p>

  Efficiency Ratios
  <a class="anchor" href="#efficiency-ratios">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Calculating the efficiency ratios for Lloyds Engineering Works Limited (LEWL) for FY2023-24 requires careful consideration of the data presented in the annual report.  Again, remember the error in the report regarding current assets.  We will use the corrected current asset value. All figures are in Lakhs unless otherwise stated.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Revenue:</strong> ₹62,423.61</li>
<li><strong>Corrected Current Assets:</strong> ₹44,827.63</li>
<li><strong>Average Inventory:</strong> (Beginning Inventory + Ending Inventory) / 2 = (11,457.99 + 10,198.30) / 2 = ₹10,828.15 (This is an approximation because the report provides beginning inventory for only FY23.)</li>
<li><strong>Average Accounts Receivable:</strong> (Beginning Receivables + Ending Receivables) / 2 = (2,909.45 + 15,181.07) / 2 = ₹9,045.26 (This is an approximation as beginning receivables for only FY23 is available.)</li>
<li><strong>Total Assets:</strong> ₹57,127.82</li>
</ul>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the calculation of the efficiency ratios:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Asset Turnover:</strong> Revenue / Average Total Assets.  <em>Approximation needed:</em> The annual report doesn&rsquo;t provide beginning total assets. Using the ending total assets as a proxy (a common simplification when beginning data is unavailable): 62,423.61 / 57,127.82 = <strong>1.09</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Inventory Turnover:</strong> Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory = 37,000.24 / 10,828.15 = <strong>3.42</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Receivables Turnover:</strong> Revenue / Average Accounts Receivable = 62,423.61 / 9,045.26 = <strong>6.90</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Interpretation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Asset Turnover (1.09):</strong>  This indicates that for every rupee of assets, LEWL generated ₹1.09 in revenue.  This ratio should be compared to industry averages and previous years&rsquo; data for better context, keeping in mind the proxy used for average total assets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Inventory Turnover (3.42):</strong> This suggests that LEWL sold and replaced its inventory 3.42 times during the year. A higher turnover ratio generally indicates efficient inventory management, which could benefit profit margins.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Receivables Turnover (6.90):</strong> LEWL collected its receivables 6.9 times during the year. This suggests a relatively efficient collection process.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Considerations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Data Approximations:</strong>  The calculations for asset turnover, inventory turnover, and receivables turnover are approximations due to the absence of data in the report for beginning assets and receivables.  These are typical when a company doesn&rsquo;t provide sufficient prior-year data.</li>
<li><strong>Industry Benchmarks:</strong> To accurately interpret these ratios, they need to be compared to LEWL&rsquo;s historical performance and relevant industry averages. The significant year-on-year growth in turnover makes comparison with the previous year less informative about efficiency gains.</li>
<li><strong>Data Accuracy:</strong> The error in the annual report presentation needs to be accounted for when interpreting these ratios.</li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, the efficiency ratios suggest reasonable asset utilization and inventory management.  The receivables turnover demonstrates an efficient collection cycle. However, the approximations used and the need for comparison to industry benchmarks and historical trends are essential for a thorough assessment of LEWL&rsquo;s operational efficiency.</p>
<h3 class="heading" id="leverage-ratios">
  Leverage Ratios
  <a class="anchor" href="#leverage-ratios">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Let&rsquo;s calculate the use ratios for Lloyds Engineering Works Limited (LEWL) for FY2023-24, using figures from the annual report.  Remember that the report doesn&rsquo;t explicitly separate long-term debt from current liabilities in the main balance sheet.  We&rsquo;ll use the corrected long-term debt figure previously calculated. All figures are in Lakhs unless otherwise stated.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Total Liabilities:</strong> ₹16,008.01</li>
<li><strong>Shareholders&rsquo; Equity:</strong> ₹41,119.81</li>
<li><strong>Total Assets:</strong> ₹57,127.82</li>
<li><strong>Corrected Long-Term Debt:</strong> ₹1,618.58 (Borrowings + Lease Liabilities (Non-current))</li>
<li><strong>EBIT (Earnings Before Interest and Taxes):</strong> ₹16,369.17 (using company&rsquo;s presentation of operating income)</li>
<li><strong>Interest Expense:</strong> ₹416.94</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the use ratios:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Debt-to-Equity Ratio:</strong> Total Liabilities / Shareholders&rsquo; Equity = 16,008.01 / 41,119.81 = <strong>0.39</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Debt-to-Assets Ratio:</strong> Total Liabilities / Total Assets = 16,008.01 / 57,127.82 = <strong>0.28</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Interest Coverage Ratio:</strong> EBIT / Interest Expense = 16,369.17 / 416.94 = <strong>39.26</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Interpretation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Debt-to-Equity Ratio (0.39):</strong> This indicates that for every rupee of equity, LEWL has ₹0.39 in debt. This is a relatively low ratio, suggesting a conservative capital structure and a lower financial risk.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Debt-to-Assets Ratio (0.28):</strong> This shows that 28% of LEWL&rsquo;s assets are financed by debt.  This is also a low ratio, implying that the company is not heavily reliant on debt financing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Interest Coverage Ratio (39.26):</strong> This signifies that LEWL&rsquo;s earnings before interest and taxes are 39.26 times higher than its interest expense. This is a very strong ratio, indicating a high ability to meet its interest obligations.  The company has a very strong capacity to cover its interest payments.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Considerations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Long-Term Debt Calculation:</strong> The long-term debt figure used here is a calculation based on the detailed information in the financial statement notes.  The company does not clearly separate current and non-current portions of debt in the main balance sheet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Industry Comparison:</strong> These ratios should be compared to industry benchmarks and LEWL&rsquo;s historical performance to gain a detailed understanding of its financial leverage.  A low debt level indicates a prudent approach and lower risk but might also indicate the company isn&rsquo;t leveraging its strong financial position to accelerate growth further.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data Accuracy:</strong> The error in the annual report&rsquo;s presentation of total assets and current assets is a matter of concern and this has been accounted for in the calculation of the ratios, based on the correction made.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In conclusion, LEWL exhibits a conservative financial use profile with low debt levels and a high capacity to service its debt obligations.  However, a thorough comparison with industry standards and past performance is recommended for a complete analysis.</p>

<p>The provided annual report gives some, but not all, of the information needed to calculate these market ratios.  Let&rsquo;s look at what&rsquo;s available and what&rsquo;s missing:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Market Cap:</strong> The report states a market capitalization (NSE) of ₹5,614.41 Crore as of March 31, 2024.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>P/E Ratio (Price-to-Earnings Ratio):</strong>  We need the current market price per share and the Earnings Per Share (EPS) to calculate this. The report provides the EPS (₹0.74 basic, ₹0.73 diluted), but the current market price isn&rsquo;t included.  Therefore, the P/E ratio cannot be calculated from the provided data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>P/B Ratio (Price-to-Book Ratio):</strong>  Similar to the P/E ratio, we need the current market price per share and the book value per share to calculate this.  The report gives the net worth, but not the number of outstanding shares, which is required to compute book value per share. Thus, the P/B ratio cannot be calculated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dividend Yield:</strong>  This requires the annual dividend per share and the current market price per share. The report gives the annual dividend (₹0.20), but the market price is missing, so the dividend yield cannot be determined.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dividend Payout Ratio:</strong>  This is calculated as (Dividends Paid / Net Income) * 100. Using the values from the report: (1,078.88 / 7,983.83) * 100 = <strong>13.51%</strong>.  (Note this payout is for the previous year&rsquo;s dividend).  The proposed dividend for FY24 would be calculated differently once approved and paid.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>In summary:</strong>  From the provided annual report, we have the market capitalization and the dividend payout ratio (for the prior year).  The P/E ratio, P/B ratio, and dividend yield cannot be computed without the missing market price per share data.  To obtain these values, you would need to find the current market price per share from a financial website such as the NSE website or a financial news source.</p>

  ESG Initiatives
  <a class="anchor" href="#esg-initiatives">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Lloyds Engineering Works Limited&rsquo;s (LEWL) 2023-24 annual report details many environmental, social, and governance (ESG) initiatives, although it lacks specific quantified data in many areas. Here&rsquo;s a summary:</p>
<p><strong>Environmental Initiatives:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Eco-Pickling Technology:</strong>  A key initiative aimed at reducing environmental impact. This new technology replaces traditional acid-based pickling methods in steel processing, minimizing harmful waste and improving sustainability.  The report highlights a technology licensing agreement with The Material Works Limited (TMW) for this technology.</li>
<li><strong>Energy Conservation:</strong>  The report mentions efforts to reduce energy intensity and increase the use of renewable energy sources, although specific targets or achievements are not provided.</li>
<li><strong>Waste Management:</strong> LEWL aims to minimize waste generation and improve recycling and disposal practices.  Steel scrap is the main waste generated, and the company works to minimize its production.</li>
<li><strong>Water Management:</strong> The report mentions the use of a Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) to treat wastewater, which is then reused for gardening purposes. This demonstrates a focus on water conservation and responsible water management.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Carbon Footprint:</strong></p>
<p>The annual report does <em>not</em> provide a quantitative measurement of LEWL&rsquo;s carbon footprint (Scope 1, 2, or 3 emissions).  This is a significant omission, given the growing importance of carbon accounting.</p>
<p><strong>Social Initiatives:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR):</strong>  LEWL&rsquo;s CSR program focuses on improving the quality of life in local communities.  The primary activity involves providing meals to the needy in Mumbai through Akshaya Chaitanya, an NGO.  They report providing meals to over 109,000 people.</li>
<li><strong>Employee Well-being:</strong> The company emphasizes employee health and safety, offering health insurance, accident insurance, and promoting a healthy work-life balance. They also have an employee stock ownership plan (ESOP) to align employee and company interests.</li>
<li><strong>Employee Training and Development:</strong> The company invests in training programs to upgrade employee skills and foster a culture of continuous improvement.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Governance Practices:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Board Composition:</strong>  The board comprises a mix of executive, non-executive, and independent directors, promoting robust corporate governance.</li>
<li><strong>Board Committees:</strong>  Several committees (Audit, Nomination &amp; Remuneration, Stakeholder Relationship, CSR, Risk Management) are in place to oversee various aspects of the business and improve transparency and accountability.</li>
<li><strong>Compliance:</strong> LEWL states its commitment to complying with applicable laws and regulations, including those related to environmental protection and corporate governance.</li>
<li><strong>Risk Management:</strong>  A dedicated risk management committee oversees risk identification, assessment, and mitigation.</li>
<li><strong>Transparency and Disclosure:</strong> The company emphasizes transparency in its financial reporting and stakeholder engagement.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Sustainability Goals:</strong></p>
<p>The annual report doesn&rsquo;t explicitly define specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) sustainability goals.  While it mentions various initiatives, it lacks quantitative targets for environmental performance, social impact, or governance improvements.</p>
<p><strong>Overall:</strong></p>
<p>LEWL demonstrates a commitment to ESG through various initiatives, but the absence of specific quantitative data, especially concerning the carbon footprint and SMART sustainability goals, limits a precise assessment of their overall sustainability performance. The report focuses heavily on qualitative descriptions of activities rather than measurable achievements.  To gain a clearer understanding of their progress, future reports should include more concrete data and targets for each ESG area.</p>

  Audit Information

</h3>
<p><strong>Auditor&rsquo;s Opinion:</strong></p>
<p>The independent auditor&rsquo;s opinion on LEWL&rsquo;s standalone financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2024, is <strong>unmodified (clean).</strong>  This means the auditors found the financial statements to present a true and fair view of the company&rsquo;s financial position, financial performance, changes in equity, and cash flows in accordance with Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) and other generally accepted accounting principles in India.  The auditors did, however, highlight key audit matters related to investments in shares, capital work in progress, and the accounting for OFCDs, warrants, and right issues.  These matters were addressed in the context of the overall audit.</p>
<p><strong>Key Accounting Policies:</strong></p>
<p>LEWL&rsquo;s key accounting policies are summarized in Note 2 of its financial statements and include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Basis of Preparation:</strong> The financial statements are prepared in accordance with Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) as notified under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013.  They follow the accrual basis of accounting and the going concern assumption.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Basis of Measurement:</strong> The historical cost convention is generally followed, except where Ind AS requires a different treatment.  Fair value measurements are applied where relevant.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Foreign Currency Transactions:</strong> Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded at the exchange rate on the transaction date. Monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the closing exchange rate, with exchange differences recognized in profit or loss.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Property, Plant, and Equipment (PPE):</strong>  PPE is initially recognized at cost and subsequently measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.  Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the assets&rsquo; useful lives.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Intangible Assets:</strong>  Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their useful lives. Goodwill, having an indefinite useful life, is not amortized but tested annually for impairment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Leases (Ind AS 116):</strong>  The Company follows Ind AS 116, recognizing right-to-use assets and lease liabilities for leases with terms exceeding 12 months.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Financial Instruments:</strong>  Financial assets are classified and measured based on their nature and how they are managed (amortized cost, FVOCI, FVTPL).  Impairment is considered based on changes in credit risk.  Financial liabilities are measured at amortized cost or fair value, depending on the instrument.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Inventories:</strong> Inventories are valued at the lower of cost (weighted average method) and net realizable value.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Taxes:</strong> Both current and deferred tax are recognized in the financial statements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Employee Benefits:</strong>  Short-term employee benefits are expensed as incurred, while post-employment benefits (like gratuity) are recognized as provisions.  Share-based payments are also accounted for based on fair value.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Revenue Recognition:</strong> Revenue is recognized when control of goods or services is transferred to the customer.  For long-term contracts, revenue is recognized based on the percentage of completion method.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These are the key accounting policies; the notes to the financial statements provide more detail on specific aspects.  It is important to review all of the notes for a complete understanding of the financial reporting practices.</p>
