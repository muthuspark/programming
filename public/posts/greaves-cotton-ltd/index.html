I. Financial Performance:
The report highlights a period of transformation and diversification for Greaves Cotton. While consolidated revenue showed a slight decrease (₹2,697.95 crore vs ₹2,766.59 crore in FY23), this is partly attributed to exceptional expenses (₹334.83 crore, primarily due to FAME subsidy refund) and a shift towards higher-margin, newer business segments. Standalone performance, however, reflects a significant increase in revenue (₹1,816.88 crore vs ₹1,592.29 crore in FY23) and profit after tax (PAT) (₹284.36 crore vs ₹115.10 crore in FY23).

<p>This analysis delves into Greaves Cotton Limited&rsquo;s annual report for the fiscal year 2023-24, examining its financial performance, business segments, identified risks, and ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) initiatives.</p>
<p><strong>I. Financial Performance:</strong></p>
<p>The report highlights a period of transformation and diversification for Greaves Cotton.  While consolidated revenue showed a slight decrease (₹2,697.95 crore vs ₹2,766.59 crore in FY23), this is partly attributed to exceptional expenses (₹334.83 crore, primarily due to FAME subsidy refund) and a shift towards higher-margin, newer business segments.  Standalone performance, however, reflects a significant increase in revenue (₹1,816.88 crore vs ₹1,592.29 crore in FY23) and profit after tax (PAT) (₹284.36 crore vs ₹115.10 crore in FY23).  Key financial highlights include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Standalone Revenue:</strong>  Significant year-on-year growth driven by strong domestic market conditions and expansion into new product categories and export markets.</li>
<li><strong>Standalone PAT:</strong> Substantial increase due to improved operating margins and the impact of exceptional income.</li>
<li><strong>Consolidated Revenue:</strong> Slight decrease due to exceptional expenses related to the FAME II subsidy issue and changes in revenue from Electric Mobility and engineering segment.</li>
<li><strong>Consolidated PAT:</strong>  Significant loss, primarily driven by exceptional expenses, particularly the voluntary refund of FAME II incentives (approximately ₹125 crore).</li>
<li><strong>Earnings Per Share (EPS):</strong>  Standalone EPS shows a substantial increase (₹12.26 vs ₹4.97 in FY23), while consolidated EPS reflects a significant loss.</li>
<li><strong>Return on Capital Employed (ROCE):</strong> Standalone ROCE indicates a healthy return (20% vs 16% in FY23).</li>
<li><strong>ROCE:</strong> Consolidated ROCE not clearly reported but given the significant loss, it&rsquo;s expected to be negative.</li>
<li><strong>Debt:</strong> No significant debt is reported in the standalone financial statements.  Consolidated debt information is not comprehensively presented.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>II. Business Segments:</strong></p>
<p>Greaves Cotton operates in a diversified portfolio of businesses, categorized as:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Engineering:</strong> This segment encompasses automotive engines (primarily for three-wheelers), non-automotive engines (for industrial, agricultural, and other applications), and Excel Controlinkage (motion control systems).  Automotive engines retained a significant market share, while the non-automotive division saw notable growth in new customer and OEM segments, along with successful export expansion. The acquisition of Excel Controlinkage adds significant scale and global reach to this segment.</li>
<li><strong>Retail:</strong>  Greaves Retail focuses on the aftermarket, providing sales, service, and spares for 3W, 2W, SCVs, and EVs.  The company is strategically expanding its footprint, particularly in Tier 2 and 3 cities, and leveraging digital platforms to improve customer engagement and supply chain efficiencies.</li>
<li><strong>Electric Mobility (GEMPL):</strong> This segment involves the design, development, and manufacturing of electric two-wheelers (Ampere brand) and electric three-wheelers (Greaves Eltra). While facing challenges related to FAME II subsidy eligibility and price increases, GEMPL remains a top five player in the electric two-wheeler market, with successful expansion into international markets.</li>
<li><strong>EV Financing (Greaves Finance):</strong>  Provides financial solutions, specifically for electric vehicles, through its digital platform &rsquo;evfin&rsquo;. The company expanded its operations significantly, establishing direct presence across 29 cities.</li>
<li><strong>Technologies (Greaves Technologies):</strong> Focuses on engineering R&amp;D services for major OEMs, offering solutions from concept to production.  It gained recognition for its innovative capabilities, particularly within the automotive sector.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>III. Risks:</strong></p>
<p>The report identifies several key risks:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Regulatory changes:</strong>  Government policies regarding fuel types and emission norms, especially in the automotive sector, pose a significant risk.</li>
<li><strong>Competition:</strong> The electric vehicle market is becoming increasingly competitive, putting pressure on pricing and margins.</li>
<li><strong>Supply chain disruptions:</strong> Geopolitical issues and material shortages could affect production and delivery timelines.</li>
<li><strong>Liquidity:</strong>  Reduced credit availability to channel partners could impact sales.</li>
<li><strong>FAME II subsidy uncertainties:</strong>  The uncertainty surrounding government incentives for electric vehicles creates challenges.</li>
<li><strong>Technological advancements:</strong> Rapid technological changes necessitate continuous investment in R&amp;D to maintain competitiveness.</li>
<li><strong>Currency fluctuations:</strong> This impacts profitability in export markets.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>IV. ESG Initiatives:</strong></p>
<p>Greaves Cotton emphasizes its commitment to sustainability, reporting on several ESG initiatives:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Environmental:</strong> Implementation of solar power plants, initiatives for recycling aluminium scrap, water conservation, and tree plantation drives.  Commitment to reducing carbon footprint and GHG emissions across various operations.</li>
<li><strong>Social:</strong>  Focus on skill development and employability enhancement programs (DEEP) for underprivileged youth. Initiatives around employee well-being, promotion of diversity and inclusion.</li>
<li><strong>Governance:</strong>  Robust corporate governance framework with independent board committees overseeing risk management, compliance, and financial reporting.  Implementation of a whistle-blower policy and transparent disclosure practices.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>V. Key Observations and Conclusions:</strong></p>
<p>Greaves Cotton&rsquo;s annual report reflects a company undergoing significant transformation, moving towards a diversified, fuel-agnostic approach.  The standalone financial results are encouraging, demonstrating strong growth and profitability.  However, the significant loss at the consolidated level, mainly driven by the FAME II issue, presents a cause for concern. The voluntary refund showcases commitment to ethical practices, but also highlights the risk associated with dependence on government incentives.  The company&rsquo;s diversification strategy across engineering, retail, electric mobility, and technology, appears promising, but the long-term success will depend on effective management of the identified risks, particularly in the rapidly evolving electric vehicle landscape.  The company&rsquo;s commitment to ESG principles is noteworthy, demonstrating a responsible approach to environmental sustainability and community engagement.</p>
<p><strong>Further Analysis Needed:</strong></p>
<p>A deeper dive into the financial statements, particularly the consolidated figures, is necessary to fully understand the Group&rsquo;s performance.  Specific details regarding the debt levels, asset valuations, and the underlying profitability of each segment, are required for a more complete financial assessment.  Qualitative analysis of the management discussion and analysis sections should complement this quantitative assessment.  Finally, independent verification of the ESG initiatives&rsquo; impact and a more detailed breakdown of the risk management strategies would further enhance the analysis.</p>

<p>The provided annual report presents both standalone and consolidated financial statements.  Therefore, the values for total assets, current assets, cash and equivalents, accounts receivable (trade receivables), and inventory will be provided separately for each.  Remember that these are reported values and may be subject to audit adjustments.</p>
<p><strong>Standalone Financial Statements (Greaves Cotton Limited):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Total Assets:</strong> ₹1,759.60 crore</li>
<li><strong>Current Assets:</strong> ₹879.70 crore</li>
<li><strong>Cash and Cash Equivalents:</strong> ₹100.01 crore</li>
<li><strong>Accounts Receivable (Trade Receivables):</strong> ₹201.08 crore</li>
<li><strong>Inventory:</strong> ₹138.03 crore</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Consolidated Financial Statements (Greaves Cotton Limited and Subsidiaries):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Total Assets:</strong> ₹2,464.39 crore</li>
<li><strong>Current Assets:</strong> ₹1,186.47 crore</li>
<li><strong>Cash and Cash Equivalents:</strong> ₹147.82 crore</li>
<li><strong>Accounts Receivable (Trade Receivables):</strong> ₹236.40 crore</li>
<li><strong>Inventory:</strong> ₹276.12 crore</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Note:</strong>  These figures are extracted directly from the provided financial statements.  It is crucial to review the accompanying notes to the financial statements for further details and clarifications on these values, including any potential adjustments or reclassifications.</p>
<h3 class="heading" id="liability-analysis">
  Liability Analysis
  <a class="anchor" href="#liability-analysis">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Similar to the assets, the liability figures are also presented separately for standalone and consolidated financial statements.  Remember that these are reported values and may be subject to audit adjustments.  Always refer to the notes accompanying the financial statements for complete details and explanations.</p>
<p><strong>Standalone Financial Statements (Greaves Cotton Limited):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Total Liabilities:</strong> ₹434.50 crore</li>
<li><strong>Current Liabilities:</strong> ₹401.64 crore</li>
<li><strong>Long-term Debt:</strong> ₹0 (No long-term debt explicitly reported; lease liabilities are shown separately)</li>
<li><strong>Accounts Payable (Trade Payables):</strong> ₹274.12 crore</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Consolidated Financial Statements (Greaves Cotton Limited and Subsidiaries):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Total Liabilities:</strong> ₹790.23 crore</li>
<li><strong>Current Liabilities:</strong> ₹689.99 crore</li>
<li><strong>Long-term Debt:</strong> ₹19.48 crore (This is primarily lease liabilities, shown separately in the standalone statements)</li>
<li><strong>Accounts Payable (Trade Payables):</strong> ₹386.04 crore</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Note:</strong>  The term &ldquo;long-term debt&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t explicitly used in the provided financial statements.  The closest equivalent is the &ldquo;Lease Liabilities&rdquo; which are broken down into current and non-current portions.  The values shown above reflect this.  Always refer to the notes to the financial statements for complete details and potential adjustments.</p>
<h3 class="heading" id="equity-analysis">
  Equity Analysis
  <a class="anchor" href="#equity-analysis">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Again, we need to differentiate between the standalone and consolidated figures.</p>
<p><strong>Standalone Financial Statements (Greaves Cotton Limited):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shareholders&rsquo; Equity:</strong> ₹1,314.10 crore</li>
<li><strong>Retained Earnings:</strong> ₹867.32 crore</li>
<li><strong>Share Capital:</strong> ₹46.40 crore</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Consolidated Financial Statements (Greaves Cotton Limited and Subsidiaries):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shareholders&rsquo; Equity:</strong> ₹1,674.16 crore (This includes equity attributable to owners of the parent and non-controlling interests).</li>
<li><strong>Retained Earnings:</strong>  Not directly reported in the consolidated equity section. The consolidated statement of changes in equity shows the change in retained earnings during the year.  To obtain the actual retained earnings value, one would need to calculate it using the opening balance and the year&rsquo;s comprehensive income.</li>
<li><strong>Share Capital:</strong> ₹46.40 crore (This remains the same as the standalone figure because share capital belongs to the parent company only)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Note:</strong>  As with previous responses, these values are extracted directly from the financial statements, and you should always consult the notes to those statements for detailed explanations, reconciliations, and potential adjustments or reclassifications.  The consolidated retained earnings, in particular, requires calculation from the statement of changes in equity due to the way that information is presented.</p>

</h2>
<h3 class="heading" id="operating-performance">
  Operating Performance
  <a class="anchor" href="#operating-performance">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Once again, we must distinguish between the standalone and consolidated figures.  All figures are in Indian Rupees (INR) in crores.</p>
<p><strong>Standalone Financial Statements (Greaves Cotton Limited):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Revenue:</strong> ₹1,816.88 crore (This includes revenue from operations and other income)</li>
<li><strong>Cost of Revenue:</strong> ₹1,589.86 crore (This includes cost of materials consumed, purchases of stock-in-trade, changes in inventories, and other direct costs)</li>
<li><strong>Gross Profit:</strong> ₹227.02 crore (Revenue - Cost of Revenue)</li>
<li><strong>Operating Expenses:</strong>  Not explicitly stated as a single line item.  It would require summing up employee benefits expense, finance costs, depreciation and amortization expense, and other expenses to arrive at a total operating expense figure.  This would be ₹1,589.86 crore - (₹7.76 crore + ₹1.77 crore + ₹41.01 crore + ₹193.20 crore) = ₹1,346.12 crore (approximately).  There may be other expenses that need to be included to arrive at the total operating expense based on your definition.</li>
<li><strong>Operating Income:</strong> ₹227.02 crore  (This is before considering other income; this would be the gross profit)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Consolidated Financial Statements (Greaves Cotton Limited and Subsidiaries):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Revenue:</strong> ₹2,697.95 crore (This includes revenue from operations and other income)</li>
<li><strong>Cost of Revenue:</strong> ₹2,635.32 crore (This is calculated by combining the cost of materials consumed, purchases of stock-in-trade, changes in inventories, and other direct costs)</li>
<li><strong>Gross Profit:</strong> ₹62.63 crore (Revenue - Cost of Revenue)</li>
<li><strong>Operating Expenses:</strong> Similar to the standalone statement, determining consolidated operating expenses needs calculation.  It would require  adding together employee benefits expense, finance costs, depreciation and amortization expense, and other expenses to obtain a total operating expense figure. A close approximation can be derived by subtracting gross profit and other income from revenue.</li>
<li><strong>Operating Income:</strong> ₹62.63 crore (This represents profit before exceptional items and taxes; it is the gross profit before other income)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Considerations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Other Income:</strong>  The figures presented for revenue above include other income. If you require revenue from operations only, this needs to be extracted from the detailed Statement of Profit and Loss.</li>
<li><strong>Exceptional Items:</strong> The consolidated figures include exceptional items.  If you need an operating income figure before exceptional items, an adjustment would be needed.</li>
<li><strong>Calculation Required:</strong>  The values for operating expenses in both standalone and consolidated statements require summation from the Statement of Profit &amp; Loss as presented in the annual report.  Your specific definition of operating expenses may require the inclusion of further items.</li>
</ul>
<p>Always refer to the notes to the financial statements for detailed explanations and potential adjustments to these values.  The presentation in the statement of profit and loss might include other line items which may need to be considered.</p>
<h3 class="heading" id="bottom-line-metrics">
  Bottom Line Metrics
  <a class="anchor" href="#bottom-line-metrics">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Again, we must separate the standalone and consolidated results.  All values are in Indian Rupees (INR) in crores, except for EPS which is per share.</p>
<p><strong>Standalone Financial Statements (Greaves Cotton Limited):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Net Income (Profit for the year):</strong> ₹284.36 crore</li>
<li><strong>EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization):</strong> ₹232 crore (This is obtained by adding back depreciation, amortization, and finance costs to the profit before tax)</li>
<li><strong>Basic EPS:</strong> ₹12.26</li>
<li><strong>Diluted EPS:</strong> ₹12.18</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Consolidated Financial Statements (Greaves Cotton Limited and Subsidiaries):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Net Income (Profit for the year):</strong> ₹(367.27) crore (A loss)</li>
<li><strong>EBITDA:</strong>  Not explicitly stated as a single line item; it would need to be calculated by adjusting profit before exceptional items and tax.</li>
<li><strong>Basic EPS:</strong> ₹(5.83) (A loss)</li>
<li><strong>Diluted EPS:</strong> ₹(5.83) (A loss)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Considerations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Exceptional Items:</strong> The consolidated net income includes exceptional items.  If you want a net income figure excluding these items, adjustments are needed.  The EBITDA for consolidated statements also needs calculation by adding back items such as depreciation, interest, and taxes.</li>
<li><strong>Share of Loss of Associate:</strong> The consolidated net income includes the share of loss from an associate. This needs to be considered when analyzing profitability.</li>
</ul>
<p>Always refer to the notes to the financial statements for complete details and potential adjustments to these values.  The report might present additional information that might affect the calculation.</p>

<p>The cash flow statement values also need to be separated into standalone and consolidated figures.  All figures are in Indian Rupees (INR) in crores.</p>
<p><strong>Standalone Financial Statements (Greaves Cotton Limited):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Operating Cash Flow:</strong> ₹183.89 crore (This represents net cash generated from operating activities)</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Operating Cash Flow:</strong> ₹(153.04) crore (This is net cash <em>used</em> in operating activities)</li>

<li><strong>Financing Cash Flow:</strong> ₹(32.01) crore (This represents net cash <em>used</em> in financing activities)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Note:</strong>  As with previous responses, it is essential to refer to the notes to the financial statements for a thorough understanding of these cash flow figures.  The report might provide additional context and details that could be relevant to your analysis.  Also note that the consolidated figures are significantly impacted by the acquisition of Excel Controlinkage Private Limited and the subsequent restructuring of loans and the refund of FAME II incentives.</p>

  Cash Flow Metrics
  <a class="anchor" href="#cash-flow-metrics">#</a>
</h3>
<p>The annual report doesn&rsquo;t directly provide a single-line item for free cash flow.  Free cash flow is a calculated metric, not a standard line item in financial statements.  We will need to calculate it based on information available in the report.  Remember that this calculation relies on the information presented and may not exactly align with other calculations or definitions of free cash flow.  We also need to distinguish between standalone and consolidated figures. All figures are in Indian Rupees (INR) in crores.</p>
<p><strong>Standalone Financial Statements (Greaves Cotton Limited):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Capital Expenditure (CAPEX):</strong> This needs to be calculated by summing the values related to property, plant, and equipment, intangible assets and capital work in progress from the statement of cash flows.  Based on the information provided, this would be ₹(36.54) + ₹(26.56) = ₹63.10 crore (approximately).  There may be other items that may affect the CAPEX calculation.</li>
<li><strong>Dividends Paid:</strong> ₹20.88 crore</li>
<li><strong>Free Cash Flow (FCF):</strong>  This requires a calculation. A common formula for FCF is:  Operating Cash Flow - Capital Expenditure.  Therefore, a possible FCF figure would be: ₹183.89 crore - ₹63.10 crore = ₹120.79 crore (approximately).  Other definitions and calculations for FCF may exist.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Consolidated Financial Statements (Greaves Cotton Limited and Subsidiaries):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Capital Expenditure (CAPEX):</strong>  This requires summation from the statement of cash flows.  Based on the information available, this would be ₹(103.53) + ₹(55.32) = ₹158.85 crore (approximately).  Further items may need to be included in the calculation based on your specific definition.</li>
<li><strong>Dividends Paid:</strong> ₹20.88 crore (This applies to the parent company only)</li>
<li><strong>Free Cash Flow (FCF):</strong> Using the standard formula of Operating Cash Flow - Capital Expenditure, the FCF would be: ₹(153.04) crore - ₹158.85 crore = ₹(309.89) crore.  Again, this is an approximation, and alternative methods for calculating FCF may yield different results.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Note:</strong>  The calculation of CAPEX and FCF above is approximate. It is crucial to examine the statement of cash flows and notes to the financial statements for a precise determination of these values.  Different definitions and methodologies for FCF calculations exist, so your specific definition might yield a different result. The consolidated figures are significantly influenced by acquisitions made during the year, as well as other adjustments.  The dividend paid is only that of the parent company, not the entire group.</p>

  Leverage Ratios
  <a class="anchor" href="#leverage-ratios">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Calculating leverage ratios requires careful consideration of the information presented in the financial statements.  The report doesn&rsquo;t explicitly detail all necessary components for a precise calculation, particularly long-term debt.  We&rsquo;ll provide approximations, bearing in mind the limitations of the available data.  All figures are in Indian Rupees (INR) in crores.</p>
<p><strong>Standalone Financial Statements (Greaves Cotton Limited):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>

<p><strong>Interest Coverage Ratio:</strong> ₹227.02 crore / ₹1.77 crore ≈ 128</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Consolidated Financial Statements (Greaves Cotton Limited and Subsidiaries):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Total Debt (Approximation):</strong> ₹68.86 crore (This is an approximation.  It&rsquo;s primarily lease liabilities, but other borrowings exist. A more precise figure would require a detailed analysis of the balance sheet.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Shareholders&rsquo; Equity:</strong> ₹1,674.16 crore</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Total Assets:</strong> ₹2,464.39 crore</p>

</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Interest Coverage Ratio:</strong> ₹61.73 crore / ₹9.23 crore ≈ 6.7</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Considerations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Debt Definition:</strong> The definition of debt used significantly impacts these ratios. The provided figures treat lease liabilities as long-term debt in the consolidated statements, but this isn&rsquo;t uniformly clear in the report.</li>
<li><strong>Approximations:</strong> The total debt figures are approximations due to the way debt is presented in the report.  A precise calculation may require more details or different considerations.</li>
<li><strong>EBIT:</strong> EBIT is used in the interest coverage calculation.  This number should be clearly extracted from the profit and loss statement and any adjustments as per your specific definition.</li>
</ul>
<p>Always recalculate these ratios with the precise numbers from the financial statements and their accompanying notes.  Consider the specific definitions and methodologies the company utilizes to ensure your results align with the reporting.  The standalone and consolidated leverage ratios differ significantly due to the acquisitions and financing structure of subsidiaries.</p>

</h3>
<p>Several of these metrics require information not directly provided in the annual report.  Specifically, the market capitalization, Price-to-Earnings (PE) ratio, and Price-to-Book (PB) ratio require the current market price of Greaves Cotton&rsquo;s shares.  The annual report only provides historical high and low prices for the year.  Therefore, we can only calculate the dividend yield and dividend payout ratio.  These are approximate values as they rely on the proposed dividend and the reported earnings.</p>
<p><strong>Values that can be calculated (approximate):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Standalone Profit After Tax (PAT):</strong> ₹284.36 crore</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Proposed Dividend per Share:</strong> ₹2</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Proposed Total Dividend Payout:</strong> ₹46.40 crore (Based on the number of outstanding shares)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Standalone EPS:</strong> ₹12.26</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dividend Yield (Approximation):</strong> This requires the current market price per share.  The formula is: (Dividend per share / Market price per share) * 100%.  This cannot be calculated without the current market price.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dividend Payout Ratio (Standalone, Approximation):</strong> (₹46.40 crore / ₹284.36 crore) * 100% ≈ 16.3%</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Values that cannot be calculated without additional information:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Market Cap:</strong> This requires the current market price per share and the number of outstanding shares.</li>
<li><strong>PE Ratio:</strong> This needs the current market price per share and the EPS.</li>
<li><strong>PB Ratio:</strong> This requires the current market price per share and the book value per share.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>To calculate the missing metrics:</strong></p>
<p>You will need to obtain the following from a financial data provider (such as Google Finance, Yahoo Finance, Bloomberg, etc.):</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Current Market Price per Share:</strong> The closing price of Greaves Cotton&rsquo;s share on a recent trading day.</li>
<li><strong>Number of Outstanding Shares:</strong> The total number of Greaves Cotton&rsquo;s shares currently issued and outstanding.</li>
<li><strong>Book Value per Share:</strong>  This is calculated by dividing the company&rsquo;s total shareholder equity by the number of outstanding shares.</li>
</ol>
<p>Once you have this data, you can calculate the missing metrics using these formulas:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Market Cap:</strong> Current Market Price per Share * Number of Outstanding Shares</li>
<li><strong>PE Ratio:</strong> Current Market Price per Share / Earnings Per Share (EPS)</li>
<li><strong>PB Ratio:</strong> Current Market Price per Share / Book Value per Share</li>
<li><strong>Dividend Yield:</strong> (Dividend per share / Market price per share) * 100%</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember that these market-based metrics are dynamic and change constantly with share price fluctuations.  The dividend payout ratio calculated here is based on standalone PAT; a consolidated figure would necessitate using consolidated PAT (which was a loss).</p>

</h3>
<p><strong>Auditor&rsquo;s Opinion:</strong></p>
<p>The independent auditor, Deloitte Haskins &amp; Sells LLP, issued an unqualified (unmodified) opinion on both the standalone and consolidated financial statements of Greaves Cotton Limited for the year ended March 31, 2024. This means the auditors found the financial statements to be fairly presented in accordance with Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) and other generally accepted accounting principles in India.  The report does note a few minor modifications related to the maintenance of accounts and audit trail requirements in the accounting software for some of the subsidiary companies.</p>
<p><strong>Key Accounting Policies:</strong></p>
<p>The annual report outlines several key accounting policies, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Basis of Preparation:</strong> The financial statements are prepared using the historical cost convention, except for certain assets (investment properties and financial instruments) measured at fair value.</li>
<li><strong>Revenue Recognition:</strong> Revenue is recognized when control of goods or services is transferred to the customer, meeting specific criteria under Ind AS 115.</li>
<li><strong>Foreign Currency Transactions:</strong> Transactions in foreign currencies are translated using exchange rates prevailing at the transaction date, with year-end retranslation of monetary items.</li>
<li><strong>Borrowing Costs:</strong> Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction, or production of qualifying assets are capitalized; others are expensed.</li>
<li><strong>Employee Benefits:</strong> Defined contribution plans are expensed as incurred; defined benefit plans are accounted for using the projected unit credit method.  Share-based payments are recognized over the vesting period.</li>
<li><strong>Goods and Services Tax (GST):</strong>  GST is generally recognized net of recoverable amounts.</li>
<li><strong>Taxation:</strong>  Both current and deferred tax are recognized, with deferred tax assets and liabilities measured at expected tax rates.</li>
<li><strong>Property, Plant, and Equipment:</strong>  Capitalized at cost, depreciated using the straight-line method over their useful lives.</li>
<li><strong>Intangible Assets:</strong>  Internally generated intangible assets are capitalized at cost once certain criteria are met; acquired intangible assets are measured at cost less accumulated amortization.</li>
<li><strong>Impairment:</strong> Assets are tested for impairment when indicators suggest the carrying amount may not be recoverable.</li>
<li><strong>Provisions:</strong> Recognized when a present obligation exists, an outflow of resources is probable, and a reliable estimate is possible.</li>
<li><strong>Financial Instruments:</strong>  Recognized when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instruments and are subsequently measured at either amortised cost or fair value, depending on the classification of the financial instruments.  Impairment is accounted for using the expected credit loss model.</li>
<li><strong>Business Combinations:</strong>  Accounted for using the acquisition method.</li>
<li><strong>Leases:</strong>  The company follows Ind AS 116, recognizing right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for most leases.</li>
</ul>
<p>These policies are applied consistently across the financial statements.  However, always refer to the complete and detailed description of the accounting policies within the annual report for a comprehensive understanding.  The notes to the financial statements provide further details and explanations.</p>
