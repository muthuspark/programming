Return on Capital Employed (ROCE) improved by 420 bps to 17.7%, indicating better capital utilization.

<p>This analysis dissects Shaily Engineering Plastics Limited&rsquo;s (SEPL) Annual Report for the fiscal year 2023-24, covering financial performance, business segments, risk management, and ESG commitments.</p>
<p><strong>I. Financial Performance:</strong></p>
<p>SEPL reported a consolidated revenue of ₹643.87 crore (₹607.07 crore in FY23), representing a modest 6.06% year-on-year (YoY) growth.  This growth, however, masks a significant improvement in profitability. Consolidated EBITDA grew substantially by 28.04% to ₹123.4 crore (₹96.4 crore in FY23), driven by higher margins in the pharmaceutical segment.  The EBITDA margin expanded by 330 basis points (bps) to 19.2%, showcasing improved operational efficiency.  Net profit surged by 63% to ₹57.3 crore (₹35.1 crore in FY23).  Return on Capital Employed (ROCE) improved by 420 bps to 17.7%, indicating better capital utilization.  The company&rsquo;s gearing improved marginally, despite increased borrowings, due to higher profits and efficient capital management.</p>
<p><strong>Key Financial Ratios:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Revenue Growth:</strong> 6.06%</li>
<li><strong>EBITDA Growth:</strong> 28.04%</li>
<li><strong>EBITDA Margin:</strong> 19.2% (up 330 bps)</li>
<li><strong>Net Profit Growth:</strong> 63%</li>
<li><strong>ROCE:</strong> 17.7% (up 420 bps)</li>
<li><strong>Debt-Equity Ratio:</strong> 0.48 (slightly improved)</li>
<li><strong>Current Ratio:</strong> 1.28 (improved liquidity)</li>
<li><strong>Interest Coverage Ratio:</strong> 1.65 (improved)</li>
</ul>
<p>The report highlights &ldquo;profitable growth,&rdquo; where profitability improved despite relatively flat revenue, indicating a shift towards higher-margin products and efficient cost management.</p>
<p><strong>II. Business Segments:</strong></p>
<p>SEPL operates across three main segments:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Healthcare (16.72% of FY24 revenue):</strong> This is the fastest-growing segment, focusing on high-precision medical devices (pen injectors, auto-injectors) for drug delivery systems.  SEPL boasts seven patent platforms and strong relationships with major global pharmaceutical companies.  The segment&rsquo;s growth is attributed to increasing demand for specialized devices and IP-protected solutions.  The company projects this segment to reach 25% of total revenue within three years.</li>
<li><strong>Consumer (48.1% of FY24 revenue):</strong> This includes home furnishings (both plastic and carbon steel), FMCG packaging, LED lights, and toys.  Key clients include Unilever, P&amp;G, and IKEA.  Growth in this segment is linked to India&rsquo;s growing middle class and demand for better quality, value-added products.</li>
<li><strong>Industrial (35.1% of FY24 revenue):</strong> This segment focuses on automotive components, appliances, and high-performance engineering components, including metal-to-plastic conversion for improved efficiency and cost reduction. Key clients include General Electric, Garrett Advancing Motion, and Schaeffler.</li>
</ul>
<p>The report emphasizes the strategic restructuring around these verticals, leveraging shared processes and material similarities to enhance efficiency and profitability.</p>
<p><strong>III. Risks and Mitigation Measures:</strong></p>
<p>The annual report identifies several key risks:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Business Operations Risk:</strong> Mitigated through a well-defined organizational framework, structured information flow, and secondary positions within each department.</li>
<li><strong>Liquidity Risk:</strong> Managed through rigorous financial planning, daily/monthly cash flow reports, and specialized banking services.</li>
<li><strong>Credit Risk:</strong> Addressed through creditworthiness assessment of customers and provisions for bad debts.</li>
<li><strong>Logistics Risk:</strong> Mitigated through dependable service providers and establishing alternative sources to ensure continuous supply.</li>
<li><strong>Market Risk:</strong> Addressed through diversification and adapting to market dynamics.</li>
<li><strong>Legal Risk:</strong> Mitigated through professional legal advice and careful contract management.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>IV. ESG Initiatives:</strong></p>
<p>SEPL demonstrates a strong commitment to ESG principles:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Environmental:</strong> Focuses on reducing environmental impact through:
<ul>
<li>Zero groundwater discharge</li>
<li>Increased use of recycled materials (37.06% of polymer in FY24)</li>
<li>Renewable energy adoption (18.45% in FY24, aiming for 100%)</li>
<li>Implementation of Lean Sigma for waste reduction</li>
<li>Investments in rainwater harvesting and sewage treatment plants.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Social:</strong> Emphasizes employee well-being, diversity (18% female employees), and community engagement through:
<ul>
<li>Robust health and safety programs</li>
<li>Comprehensive training programs</li>
<li>Community development projects (₹25.13 lakh spent in FY24)</li>
<li>Women&rsquo;s empowerment initiatives.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Governance:</strong>  Highlights strong corporate governance practices including:
<ul>
<li>A diverse and independent Board of Directors</li>
<li>Well-defined committees (Audit, Nomination &amp; Remuneration, Stakeholders’ Relationship, CSR, and Risk Management)</li>
<li>Robust risk management framework</li>
<li>Compliance with international and national quality standards (ISO 9001, IATF 16949, MDSAP, etc.).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>V.  Overall Assessment:</strong></p>
<p>Shaily Engineering Plastics Limited demonstrates a robust business model with a strong focus on high-precision components, particularly within the growing medical devices sector.  The company&rsquo;s strategic diversification, coupled with its commitment to operational efficiency and ESG principles, positions it well for future growth.  The  &ldquo;profitable growth&rdquo; strategy is noteworthy, suggesting a successful shift towards value-added products and efficient cost management. While the revenue growth in FY24 was modest, the significant improvement in profitability and key financial ratios indicate a strong financial performance. The comprehensive risk management and detailed ESG disclosures further enhance the company&rsquo;s transparency and credibility.  The focus on India&rsquo;s growing manufacturing sector and its export-oriented strategy presents considerable long-term potential. However, dependence on a few large customers remains a risk to be carefully monitored.</p>

<p>The following figures are from Shaily Engineering Plastics Limited&rsquo;s Standalone Statement of Profit &amp; Loss for the year ended March 31, 2024 (in ₹lakhs):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Revenue from Operations:</strong> ₹61,597.36 lakhs</li>
<li><strong>Cost of Revenue (Cost of Materials Consumed + Changes in Inventories):</strong> ₹37,504.14 lakhs - ₹494.54 lakhs = ₹37,009.60 lakhs</li>
<li><strong>Gross Profit:</strong> ₹61,597.36 lakhs - ₹37,009.60 lakhs = ₹24,587.76 lakhs</li>
<li><strong>Operating Expenses (Power &amp; Fuel + Employee Benefits Expense + Depreciation &amp; Amortization Expense + Other Expenses):</strong> ₹2,918.88 lakhs + ₹5,589.67 lakhs + ₹3,468.72 lakhs + ₹6,601.48 lakhs = ₹18,578.75 lakhs</li>
<li><strong>Operating Income (Gross Profit - Operating Expenses):</strong> ₹24,587.76 lakhs - ₹18,578.75 lakhs = ₹6,009.01 lakhs</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Note:</strong>  These calculations use the standalone figures.  The consolidated statement of profit and loss will include data from the subsidiary, leading to different values for these items.  Also, the classification of expenses might vary slightly depending on the specific accounting treatments used.  The annual report itself doesn&rsquo;t explicitly provide a single &ldquo;Operating Expenses&rdquo; line.  The above is a calculation based on the expenses explicitly listed that are most appropriately categorized as operating expenses.</p>
<h3 class="heading" id="bottom-line-metrics">
  Bottom Line Metrics
  <a class="anchor" href="#bottom-line-metrics">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Based on Shaily Engineering Plastics Limited&rsquo;s Standalone Statement of Profit &amp; Loss for the year ended March 31, 2024:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Net Income (Profit for the year):</strong> ₹3,612.98 lakhs</li>
<li><strong>EBITDA (Profit before tax + Interest expense + Depreciation &amp; Amortization):</strong> ₹4,868.63 lakhs + ₹1,789.63 lakhs + ₹3,468.72 lakhs = ₹10,126.98 lakhs</li>
<li><strong>Basic EPS:</strong> ₹7.88</li>
<li><strong>Diluted EPS:</strong> ₹7.88</li>
</ul>
<p>These are the standalone figures. The consolidated statement of profit and loss will provide different values for these metrics due to the inclusion of the subsidiary&rsquo;s results.

<p>Based on Shaily Engineering Plastics Limited&rsquo;s Standalone Statement of Cash Flows for the year ended March 31, 2024 (in ₹lakhs):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cash Flow from Operating Activities:</strong> ₹7,447.39 lakhs</li>
<li><strong>Cash Flow from Investing Activities:</strong> ₹(9,237.73) lakhs  <em>(negative indicating net cash outflow)</em></li>

<h3 class="heading" id="cash-flow-metrics">
  Cash Flow Metrics
  <a class="anchor" href="#cash-flow-metrics">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Shaily Engineering Plastics Limited&rsquo;s annual report doesn&rsquo;t explicitly state free cash flow, capital expenditure, or dividends paid as single line items.  We need to calculate these from the provided data:</p>
<p><strong>1. Capital Expenditure (CAPEX):</strong></p>
<p>The report mentions a CAPEX of ₹97.07 crore (₹9707 lakhs) for FY24, including work in progress. This is stated in the Management Discussion and Analysis section.</p>
<p><strong>2. Dividends Paid:</strong></p>
<p>The board recommended a final dividend of ₹1 per equity share (face value ₹2) for FY24.  The total number of shares is 4,58,67,510. Therefore, the total dividend payout would be:</p>
<p>₹1/share * 4,58,67,510 shares = ₹4,58,67,510</p>
<p>This translates to ₹458.68 lakhs.  This is <em>subject to shareholder approval</em> at the AGM.  The report does not state whether the dividend was actually paid.  The actual amount paid might be different and would be shown in the subsequent year&rsquo;s financial statements.</p>
<p><strong>3. Free Cash Flow (FCF):</strong></p>
<p>Free cash flow is calculated as:</p>
<p>FCF = Operating Cash Flow - Capital Expenditures - Dividend Payments</p>
<p>Using the standalone figures (which may differ slightly depending on exact categorization used):</p>
<p>FCF = ₹7,447.39 lakhs - ₹9,707 lakhs - ₹458.68 lakhs = ₹(2,718.29) lakhs</p>
<p>Therefore, according to this calculation using standalone figures, the free cash flow was negative ₹271.83 crore.</p>
<p><strong>Important Note:</strong>  These calculations are estimates based on the available information. The exact free cash flow figure, as well as the actual dividend paid, might vary based on accounting treatment, and specific items not explicitly categorized.  The consolidated figures would further change due to the inclusion of the subsidiary&rsquo;s data.  For precise values, refer to the subsequent year&rsquo;s financial statement or official announcements.</p>
<h3 class="heading" id="profitability-ratios">
  Profitability Ratios
  <a class="anchor" href="#profitability-ratios">#</a>
</h3>
<p>To calculate these profitability ratios for Shaily Engineering Plastics Limited, we&rsquo;ll use the standalone figures from the financial statements.  Keep in mind that using the consolidated figures would yield different results.  Also, slight variations may be possible due to rounding differences.</p>
<p><strong>Standalone Figures (in ₹lakhs):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Revenue:</strong> ₹61,597.36</li>
<li><strong>Cost of Revenue:</strong> ₹37,009.60 (calculated as Cost of Materials Consumed + Changes in Inventories)</li>
<li><strong>Gross Profit:</strong> ₹24,587.76</li>
<li><strong>Operating Income:</strong> ₹6,009.01 (estimated based on the expenses most appropriately categorized as operating)</li>
<li><strong>Net Income:</strong> ₹3,612.98</li>
<li><strong>Shareholders&rsquo; Equity (Average):</strong> ₹(43148.24 + 39563.37)/2 = ₹41,355.81</li>
<li><strong>Total Assets (Average):</strong> ₹(75207.89 + 68464.33)/2 = ₹71,836.11</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Profitability Ratios:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Gross Profit Margin:</strong> (Gross Profit / Revenue) * 100 = (₹24,587.76 / ₹61,597.36) * 100 = <strong>39.92%</strong></li>
<li><strong>Operating Profit Margin:</strong> (Operating Income / Revenue) * 100 = (₹6,009.01 / ₹61,597.36) * 100 = <strong>9.76%</strong></li>
<li><strong>Net Profit Margin:</strong> (Net Income / Revenue) * 100 = (₹3,612.98 / ₹61,597.36) * 100 = <strong>5.86%</strong></li>
<li><strong>Return on Equity (ROE):</strong> (Net Income / Average Shareholders&rsquo; Equity) * 100 = (₹3,612.98 / ₹41,355.81) * 100 = <strong>8.74%</strong></li>
<li><strong>Return on Assets (ROA):</strong> (Net Income / Average Total Assets) * 100 = (₹3,612.98 / ₹71,836.11) * 100 = <strong>5.04%</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Note:</strong> These calculations are based on the standalone financial statements.  The consolidated financial statements would result in different ratios.  Additionally,  the precise operating income figure is an approximation, as the report doesn&rsquo;t provide a single line item for this metric, requiring a calculation based on various expense categories.</p>

  Liquidity Ratios
  <a class="anchor" href="#liquidity-ratios">#</a>
</h3>
<p>To calculate these liquidity ratios for Shaily Engineering Plastics Limited, we&rsquo;ll use the standalone figures from the balance sheet as of March 31, 2024 (in ₹lakhs):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Current Assets:</strong> ₹24,027.31</li>
<li><strong>Current Liabilities:</strong> ₹22,696.07</li>
<li><strong>Quick Assets (Current Assets - Inventory):</strong> ₹24,027.31 - ₹8,360.35 = ₹15,666.96</li>
<li><strong>Cash and Cash Equivalents:</strong> ₹441.91</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Liquidity Ratios:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Current Ratio:</strong> Current Assets / Current Liabilities = ₹24,027.31 / ₹22,696.07 = <strong>1.06</strong></li>
<li><strong>Quick Ratio:</strong> Quick Assets / Current Liabilities = ₹15,666.96 / ₹22,696.07 = <strong>0.69</strong></li>
<li><strong>Cash Ratio:</strong> Cash and Cash Equivalents / Current Liabilities = ₹441.91 / ₹22,696.07 = <strong>0.02</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Interpretation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Current Ratio of 1.06:</strong> This is slightly below the generally accepted ideal range of 1.5 to 2.  It suggests that the company might have some short-term liquidity concerns, meaning they may have difficulty meeting their short-term obligations with their current assets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Quick Ratio of 0.69:</strong> This is considerably below the generally preferred quick ratio of at least 1. It indicates a lower ability to meet its short-term obligations without relying on the sale of inventories.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cash Ratio of 0.02:</strong> This very low cash ratio indicates a significant reliance on the sale of inventories and other current assets to meet short-term obligations. This is a concerningly low ratio.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Note:</strong> These calculations use standalone figures.  The consolidated ratios will be different.  Also, the interpretation of these ratios should be done within the context of the company&rsquo;s industry, historical performance, and overall financial health.  A low current and quick ratio could be problematic if the company cannot readily convert its inventory into cash.  The company&rsquo;s management discussion highlights some attention to working capital management.</p>
<h3 class="heading" id="efficiency-ratios">
  Efficiency Ratios
  <a class="anchor" href="#efficiency-ratios">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Calculating efficiency ratios for Shaily Engineering Plastics Limited requires using data from both the income statement and balance sheet. We will use the standalone figures. Remember that consolidated figures would produce different results.  Also, there&rsquo;s some ambiguity regarding precise values depending on what sales/cost figures are used in calculations (e.g., net sales vs. gross sales).  We will use the most straightforward approach possible given the available information.</p>
<p><strong>Standalone Figures (in ₹lakhs):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Net Sales (Revenue):</strong> ₹61,597.36</li>
<li><strong>Average Total Assets:</strong> ₹(75,207.89 + 68,464.33)/2 = ₹71,836.11</li>
<li><strong>Cost of Goods Sold (COGS):</strong> ₹37,009.60  (calculated previously as Cost of Materials Consumed + Changes in Inventories)</li>
<li><strong>Average Inventory:</strong> ₹(8,360.35 + 7,297.47)/2 = ₹7,828.91</li>
<li><strong>Average Accounts Receivable:</strong> ₹(11,174.68 + 8,879.39)/2 = ₹10,027.04</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Efficiency Ratios:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Asset Turnover:</strong> Net Sales / Average Total Assets = ₹61,597.36 / ₹71,836.11 = <strong>0.86 times</strong></li>
<li><strong>Inventory Turnover:</strong> Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory = ₹37,009.60 / ₹7,828.91 = <strong>4.73 times</strong></li>
<li><strong>Receivables Turnover:</strong> Net Sales / Average Accounts Receivable = ₹61,597.36 / ₹10,027.04 = <strong>6.15 times</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Interpretation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Asset Turnover of 0.86 times:</strong> This indicates that for every ₹1 of assets, the company generated ₹0.86 of sales.  This is a relatively low turnover, suggesting the company may not be utilizing its assets as efficiently as possible.  Further analysis is needed to determine if this is industry-standard or if there&rsquo;s room for improvement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Inventory Turnover of 4.73 times:</strong> This means the company sold and replaced its inventory 4.73 times during the year.  This is a reasonable turnover rate, though a higher rate would typically be more desirable in many industries.  Further analysis would require industry benchmarks for comparison.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Receivables Turnover of 6.15 times:</strong> The company collected and re-generated its receivables 6.15 times during the year.  This suggests relatively efficient management of accounts receivables.  Again, industry benchmarks are needed for a thorough evaluation.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Considerations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Standalone vs. Consolidated:</strong>  These ratios are based on standalone data.  Consolidated figures would provide a different picture.</li>
<li><strong>Industry Benchmarks:</strong>  Comparing these ratios to industry averages is essential for a meaningful assessment of SEPL&rsquo;s efficiency.  Without industry data, the interpretation is limited.</li>
<li><strong>Data Limitations:</strong>  Some approximations were necessary in these calculations due to the absence of explicit line items in the financial statements (e.g., using a simple average for assets and receivables).  More detailed information would lead to greater precision.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="heading" id="leverage-ratios">
  Leverage Ratios
  <a class="anchor" href="#leverage-ratios">#</a>
</h3>
<p>To calculate these leverage ratios for Shaily Engineering Plastics Limited, we will use the standalone figures from the balance sheet and income statement as of March 31, 2024 (in ₹lakhs). Remember that using consolidated figures would yield different results.</p>
<p><strong>Standalone Figures:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Total Debt (Long-term debt + Current borrowings):</strong> ₹6,983.30 + ₹13,851.88 = ₹20,835.18</li>
<li><strong>Shareholders&rsquo; Equity:</strong> ₹43,148.24</li>
<li><strong>Total Assets:</strong> ₹75,207.89</li>
<li><strong>EBIT (Earnings Before Interest and Taxes):</strong> ₹6,009.01 (This is an approximation, calculated previously as operating income)</li>
<li><strong>Interest Expense:</strong> ₹1,789.63</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Leverage Ratios:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Debt-to-Equity Ratio:</strong> Total Debt / Shareholders&rsquo; Equity = ₹20,835.18 / ₹43,148.24 = <strong>0.48</strong></li>
<li><strong>Debt-to-Assets Ratio:</strong> Total Debt / Total Assets = ₹20,835.18 / ₹75,207.89 = <strong>0.28</strong></li>
<li><strong>Interest Coverage Ratio:</strong> EBIT / Interest Expense = ₹6,009.01 / ₹1,789.63 = <strong>3.36</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Interpretation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Debt-to-Equity Ratio of 0.48:</strong> This indicates that the company has ₹0.48 of debt for every ₹1 of equity.  This suggests a moderate level of financial leverage.  Whether this is considered high or low depends on industry benchmarks and the company&rsquo;s overall risk profile.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Debt-to-Assets Ratio of 0.28:</strong> This shows that 28% of the company&rsquo;s assets are financed by debt.  Again, the assessment of whether this is high or low requires comparison to industry averages and the company&rsquo;s specific circumstances.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Interest Coverage Ratio of 3.36:</strong> This means the company&rsquo;s earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) are 3.36 times its interest expense. This indicates a reasonable ability to meet its interest obligations. A higher ratio generally suggests a stronger ability to service debt.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Considerations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Standalone vs. Consolidated:</strong> These ratios are based on standalone data.  The consolidated ratios will be different.</li>
<li><strong>Industry Benchmarks:</strong> Comparing these ratios to industry averages is essential for a complete understanding of the company&rsquo;s financial leverage.</li>
<li><strong>Qualitative Factors:</strong>  A thorough evaluation of leverage also considers qualitative factors such as the company&rsquo;s cash flow generation, profitability, and overall financial health.  A company with strong cash flows and high profitability can handle a higher level of debt more easily.  A more complete assessment requires analysis of the company&rsquo;s cash flow statement and other relevant financial information.</li>

  Market Metrics
  <a class="anchor" href="#market-metrics">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Several of these metrics require information not fully provided in the annual report. We can calculate some, but others require additional market data (like the share price).</p>
<p><strong>1. Market Capitalization:</strong></p>
<p>The report states a market capitalization of ₹2,430 crore (₹243000 lakhs) as of March 31, 2024, on both the BSE and NSE.</p>
<p><strong>2. Price-to-Earnings Ratio (PE Ratio):</strong></p>
<p>The PE ratio cannot be calculated without knowing the current market price per share.  The annual report provides the EPS (Earnings Per Share), but the market price is needed to complete the calculation:</p>
<p>PE Ratio = Market Price per Share / Earnings Per Share</p>
<p><strong>3. Price-to-Book Ratio (PB Ratio):</strong></p>
<p>Similar to the PE ratio, the PB ratio requires the market price per share and the book value per share (which can be derived from shareholders&rsquo; equity and the number of shares):</p>
<p>PB Ratio = Market Price per Share / Book Value per Share</p>
<p><strong>4. Dividend Yield:</strong></p>
<p>The report states a recommended final dividend of ₹1 per share.  To calculate the dividend yield, we need the market price per share:</p>
<p>Dividend Yield = (Annual Dividend per Share / Market Price per Share) * 100</p>
<p><strong>5. Dividend Payout Ratio:</strong></p>
<p>We can estimate the dividend payout ratio using the standalone figures.  The recommended dividend is ₹458.68 lakhs, and the net income (standalone) is ₹3612.98 lakhs:</p>
<p>Dividend Payout Ratio = (Dividends Paid / Net Income) * 100 = (₹458.68 lakhs / ₹3612.98 lakhs) * 100 = <strong>12.70%</strong></p>
<p><em>Note:</em> This is based on the <em>recommended</em> dividend.  The actual payout ratio might differ if the shareholders don&rsquo;t approve the full amount or if there are adjustments.</p>
<p><strong>In Summary:</strong></p>
<p>We can only definitively provide the market capitalization from the report (₹2,430 crore). Calculating the PE ratio, PB ratio, and dividend yield requires the current market price per share, which is not included in the annual report itself.  We have provided an estimated dividend payout ratio based on the recommended dividend.  You would need to obtain the current market share price from a financial website to complete the calculation of the missing ratios.</p>

  </tbody>
</table>
<p><strong>II. Qualitative Assessment (Impact &amp; Likelihood):</strong></p>
<p>The report does <em>not</em> provide quantitative assessments (e.g., high, medium, low) for the likelihood or severity of these risks.  A full risk assessment would require a separate analysis beyond the annual report&rsquo;s information.  However, a qualitative assessment can be inferred from the detail and prominence given to certain risks in the report.</p>
<p>For example, the detailed discussion of risk mitigation for liquidity suggests that this is considered a significant risk.  Similarly, the substantial detail regarding HSE risks and mitigation implies a high focus on this area, suggesting the management&rsquo;s concern about the associated impact and likelihood.</p>
<p><strong>III. Trends:</strong></p>
<p>The risk profile of the company is largely influenced by factors impacting both the global and Indian markets:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Geopolitical Instability and Global Slowdowns:</strong> The report specifically mentions the impact of the Ukraine-Russia war and Red Sea disturbances on logistics costs and overall market sentiment.  This highlights a persistent risk related to global economic uncertainty.</li>
<li><strong>India&rsquo;s Growing Economy:</strong> India&rsquo;s growth provides both opportunities and challenges.  The rising demand and changes in consumer behavior offer growth prospects, but increased competition in India&rsquo;s manufacturing sector remains a risk.</li>
<li><strong>Technological Advancements:</strong>  The need for continuous technology upgrades is identified as a key challenge, indicating that the company needs to adapt and innovate constantly to stay competitive.</li>
<li><strong>Supply Chain Disruptions:</strong>  Global supply chain disruptions continue to be a major concern and highlight the need for the company to proactively manage suppliers and diversify its sourcing strategies.</li>
<li><strong>ESG Concerns:</strong> The rising prominence of ESG factors presents both an opportunity and a challenge.  Meeting increasingly stringent environmental and social standards requires continuous investment and adaptation, but doing so also improves a company&rsquo;s reputation, and access to funds, creating a competitive advantage.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>IV. Limitations:</strong></p>
<p>The report offers a good overview of the risks, but a full and in-depth risk assessment would require additional quantitative analysis, detailed risk scoring/ranking, and likely industry benchmarks for comparison. The qualitative assessment provided here is based on the prominence given to various risks and mitigation strategies in the report.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Waste Reduction:</strong>  Utilizing Lean Sigma principles to reduce waste across operations,  reintroducing plastic waste back into the manufacturing process, and disposing of waste through GPCB-approved agencies.  37.06% of raw material used was from recycled polymer.

</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Carbon Emission Monitoring:</strong> Monitoring CO2 emissions from power and fuel consumption.  Plans to install 1 MW of solar power in FY25.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>II. Carbon Footprint:</strong></p>
<p>The report lacks a comprehensive disclosure of its total Scope 1, 2, and 3 greenhouse gas emissions. The report does mention the metric of total Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, and the intensity for both current and previous years.  While the company is monitoring its carbon footprint, specific quantitative data is limited.  Further details would require external data sources or direct inquiry to SEPL.</p>
<p><strong>III. Social Initiatives:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Employee Well-being:</strong>  Focus on employee health and safety through regular medical checkups, a 24/7 occupational health center, employee insurance, and various employee engagement programs.  Maintaining 18% female employment and aiming for improved gender diversity.</p>

Spent ₹25.13 lakh on CSR activities in FY24.  Includes support for orphanages, schools for disabled children, and assistance for local health centers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Supply Chain Ethics:</strong>  Maintaining a stable ecosystem of vendors through long-term partnerships and periodic audits.  A commitment to fair labor practices is highlighted, though specific details are limited.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>IV. Governance Practices:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Board Composition:</strong>  A diverse Board comprising executive directors and independent directors, including a significant number of independent directors and female representation, designed to ensure good corporate governance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Committees:</strong>  Dedicated committees (Audit, Nomination &amp; Remuneration, Stakeholders’ Relationship, CSR, and Risk Management) oversee various aspects of the business and promote responsible decision-making.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Compliance:</strong>  Strict adherence to various quality, environmental, health, and safety standards and certifications.  A commitment to transparent financial reporting and ethical conduct is expressed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Vigil Mechanism:</strong>  A formal &ldquo;Whistleblower Policy&rdquo; in place to encourage reporting of unethical behavior and ensure employee protection.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>V. Sustainability Goals:</strong></p>
<p>The annual report does not provide explicit, clearly defined sustainability goals with quantifiable targets and deadlines. While various initiatives show a commitment to sustainability, there&rsquo;s a lack of formal targets such as emission reductions targets, renewable energy targets, or waste reduction targets with specific timeframes. The report showcases ambitions (100% renewable energy, water-positive status, etc.) but lacks formal, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) goals.</p>
<p><strong>In Summary:</strong></p>
<p>Shaily Engineering Plastics Limited demonstrates a proactive approach to ESG through a range of initiatives.  However,  the report&rsquo;s limited disclosure of key metrics hinders a complete quantitative assessment of its environmental performance and progress toward specific sustainability goals. Further information from the company would be needed for a more complete understanding.</p>
