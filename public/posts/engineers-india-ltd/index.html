  <meta property="og:description" content="Overview # Detailed Analysis # This analysis examines Engineers India Limited’s (EIL) 2023-24 Annual Report, focusing on key financial metrics, business segments, identified risks, and ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) initiatives.
I. Financial Performance:
EIL reported a robust financial performance despite a challenging global environment. Key highlights include:
Revenue: ₹3232.16 crore (nearly flat compared to ₹3283.76 crore in FY2022-23). This stability is notable given global market uncertainties. Profit After Tax (PAT): ₹356.99 crore (a slight increase compared to ₹342.15 crore in FY2022-23). The consolidated PAT showed a significant 29% year-on-year increase to ₹445 crore, largely driven by increased profit share from Ramagundam Fertilisers and Chemicals Limited (RFCL). EBITDA: ₹507.94 crore. Order Book: ₹7823 crore as of March 31, 2024, providing a strong foundation for future revenue. New orders secured in FY2023-24 totaled ₹3406 crore (₹2907 crore domestically and ₹499 crore overseas). This includes a significant number of OBE/LSTK (Owning, Building, Equipping, Leasing/Lump Sum Turnkey) contracts. Debtor Days: Improved to 35 days from 39 days in the previous year, indicating better cash flow management. Dividend Payout: The board recommended a final dividend of ₹1 per share (in addition to an interim dividend of ₹2), totaling ₹3 per share. This represents a 47.23% payout of standalone profits.

<p>This analysis examines Engineers India Limited&rsquo;s (EIL) 2023-24 Annual Report, focusing on key financial metrics, business segments, identified risks, and ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) initiatives.</p>
<p><strong>I. Financial Performance:</strong></p>
<p>EIL reported a robust financial performance despite a challenging global environment.  Key highlights include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Revenue:</strong> ₹3232.16 crore (nearly flat compared to ₹3283.76 crore in FY2022-23). This stability is notable given global market uncertainties.</li>
<li><strong>Profit After Tax (PAT):</strong> ₹356.99 crore (a slight increase compared to ₹342.15 crore in FY2022-23).  The consolidated PAT showed a significant 29% year-on-year increase to ₹445 crore, largely driven by increased profit share from Ramagundam Fertilisers and Chemicals Limited (RFCL).</li>

This includes a significant number of OBE/LSTK (Owning, Building, Equipping, Leasing/Lump Sum Turnkey) contracts.</li>
<li><strong>Debtor Days:</strong> Improved to 35 days from 39 days in the previous year, indicating better cash flow management.</li>
<li><strong>Dividend Payout:</strong>  The board recommended a final dividend of ₹1 per share (in addition to an interim dividend of ₹2), totaling ₹3 per share. This represents a 47.23% payout of standalone profits.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key Financial Ratios (Standalone):</strong></p>

<li><strong>Trade Receivables/Turnover:</strong> 1.17 months (FY2023-24) vs 1.29 months (FY2022-23)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>II. Business Segments:</strong></p>
<p>EIL operates in two primary segments:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Consultancy &amp; Engineering:</strong> This segment focuses on providing design, engineering, and project management services.  It saw a 3% year-on-year increase in revenue in FY2023-24.</li>
<li><strong>Turnkey Projects:</strong> This segment handles the execution of projects on an LSTK or OBE basis (Lump Sum Turnkey/Open Book Estimate).  Revenue in this segment was slightly lower in FY2023-24 compared to FY2022-23.</li>
</ul>
<p>The report highlights EIL&rsquo;s expansion into various sectors like infrastructure, renewables (solar, wind), green hydrogen/ammonia, biofuels (2G Ethanol, SAF), and waste-to-energy.  This diversification strategy aims to mitigate risk and capitalize on growth opportunities in emerging markets.  The report meticulously outlines many notable projects in each of these sectors, both domestically and internationally.</p>
<p><strong>III. Risks:</strong></p>
<p>EIL&rsquo;s risk management framework, aligned with ISO 31000 principles, identifies and addresses many key risks:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Market Volatility:</strong> Fluctuations in demand for engineering services and geopolitical instability are addressed through portfolio diversification and flexible project planning.</li>
<li><strong>Project Execution Challenges:</strong> Delays and inefficiencies are mitigated through robust project management and proactive risk management.</li>
<li><strong>Supply Chain Disruptions:</strong> The company is working to develop multiple supplier relationships to mitigate potential disruptions.</li>
<li><strong>Foreign Exchange Exposure:</strong> This risk is managed through internal revenue hedging.</li>
<li><strong>Liquidity Constraints:</strong>  EIL maintains robust cash flow management practices.</li>
<li><strong>Regulatory Compliance:</strong>  The company has a robust compliance program to minimize compliance risks.</li>
<li><strong>Technological and Cyber Risks:</strong> While the report doesn&rsquo;t specify mitigation strategies, the creation of a Digital Technology Solutions (DTS) division suggests a proactive approach to address technological advancements and cybersecurity.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>IV. ESG Initiatives:</strong></p>
<p>EIL demonstrates a strong commitment to ESG, with many key initiatives:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Net Zero Target:</strong>  The company aims to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2035, through a multi-phased plan focusing on energy efficiency, renewable energy sources (solar, wind), and the reduction of its overall carbon footprint.</li>
<li><strong>Environmental Stewardship:</strong> Initiatives include rainwater harvesting, sewage treatment and reuse, waste reduction and recycling, and the creation of a Miyawaki forest.</li>
<li><strong>Social Responsibility (CSR):</strong> EIL spent ₹11.87 crore on CSR activities, focusing on healthcare, education, skill development, women&rsquo;s empowerment, and environmental protection.  Significant projects included establishing model Anganwadi centers, providing medical equipment to rural hospitals, and developing a Miyawaki forest.</li>
<li><strong>Human Capital Development:</strong>  EIL places strong emphasis on employee well-being, training, and development, with initiatives like mentorship programs, skill development programs, and health and wellness programs.  The report highlights efforts to improve workforce diversity and inclusion.</li>
<li><strong>Corporate Governance:</strong> EIL highlights its commitment to transparent and accountable corporate governance practices.  The report details Board composition, committee activities, and compliance with relevant regulations.  However, there were some minor non-compliances related to board composition and independent director evaluation, which were addressed.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>V.  Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>EIL&rsquo;s 2023-24 Annual Report reveals a company navigating a complex global landscape while maintaining a strong financial position and demonstrating a clear commitment to sustainable growth and ESG principles.  The diversification strategy, robust risk management framework, and proactive ESG initiatives position EIL favorably for future success.  However, continued monitoring of key risks, especially those related to project execution and the global energy transition, will be essential for sustaining this positive trajectory.  The report&rsquo;s detail and transparency are commendable.</p>

<h3 class="heading" id="cash-flow-metrics">
  Cash Flow Metrics
  <a class="anchor" href="#cash-flow-metrics">#</a>
</h3>
<p>The provided annual report doesn&rsquo;t explicitly state the free cash flow.  However, we can calculate it and determine the capital expenditure and dividends paid using the information provided:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Capital Expenditure (CAPEX):</strong>  The report states that capital expenditure primarily includes expenses on office renovation, furniture, fixtures, R&amp;D, and IT assets.  A precise figure for CAPEX isn&rsquo;t directly given in the main financial statements, but from the Standalone Cash Flow Statement, we can see that <strong>purchases of property, plant, equipment, investment property, intangible assets and intangible assets under development (including capital work-in-progress) totaled ₹3,336.16 lakhs</strong>. This is a good proxy for CAPEX.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dividends Paid:</strong> The report states that ₹16,861.27 lakhs in dividends were paid during the year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Free Cash Flow (FCF):</strong>  Free cash flow is a metric that indicates the cash a company has available for distribution to its shareholders or reinvestment in the business after covering its operating expenses and capital expenditures.  There&rsquo;s no direct figure presented in the report.  However, we can estimate it as follows:</p>
<p><strong>FCF ≈ Operating Cash Flow - Capital Expenditures</strong></p>
<p>Therefore, an <em>estimated</em> Free Cash Flow would be:</p>
<p>₹20,954.11 lakhs - ₹3,336.16 lakhs = <strong>₹17,617.95 lakhs</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Considerations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This FCF calculation is an <em>approximation</em>.  A more precise calculation would require a more detailed breakdown of capital expenditures and possibly adjustments for changes in working capital.</li>
<li>The report provides a consolidated PAT and revenue figures which is higher than the Standalone PAT and Revenue. It&rsquo;s recommended to calculate a more accurate FCF figure using the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement if available.</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, while precise figures are unavailable for all three metrics from the standalone statement, we can derive reasonable estimates based on the information presented.  Refer to consolidated statements for a more complete picture.</p>
<h3 class="heading" id="profitability-ratios">
  Profitability Ratios
  <a class="anchor" href="#profitability-ratios">#</a>
</h3>
<p>To calculate the profitability ratios for Engineers India Limited for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024, we&rsquo;ll use the standalone financial statement figures.  Remember, these will differ from consolidated figures.  All values are calculated using figures in Indian Rupees in Lakhs.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Gross Margin:</strong> This is calculated as (Revenue - Cost of Revenue) / Revenue.</p>
<p>(₹3,23,216.50 - ₹2,95,182.00) / ₹3,23,216.50 = <strong>8.65%</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Operating Margin:</strong> This is calculated as Operating Income / Revenue.</p>
<p>₹9,841.88 / ₹3,23,216.50 = <strong>3.04%</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Net Profit Margin:</strong> This is calculated as Net Income / Revenue.</p>
<p>₹3,569.91 / ₹3,23,216.50 = <strong>1.10%</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Return on Equity (ROE):</strong> This is calculated as Net Income / Average Shareholders&rsquo; Equity.  We need to calculate the average shareholders&rsquo; equity:</p>
<p>Average Shareholders&rsquo; Equity = (Beginning Shareholders&rsquo; Equity + Ending Shareholders&rsquo; Equity) / 2
Average Shareholders&rsquo; Equity = (₹2,10,566.05 + ₹2,31,127.89) / 2 = ₹2,20,846.97</p>
<p>ROE = ₹3,569.91 / ₹2,20,846.97 = <strong>1.61%</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Return on Assets (ROA):</strong> This is calculated as Net Income / Average Total Assets. We need to calculate the average total assets:</p>
<p>Average Total Assets = (Beginning Total Assets + Ending Total Assets) / 2
Average Total Assets = (₹4,51,189.88 + ₹4,77,144.26) / 2 = ₹4,64,167.07</p>
<p>ROA = ₹3,569.91 / ₹4,64,167.07 = <strong>0.77%</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Note:</strong> These calculations use the standalone figures.  Using the consolidated financial statement data would yield different results.  Also, the &ldquo;Cost of Revenue&rdquo; is inferred from the statement of profit and loss as it does not explicitly present the figure in that manner.  There might be minor discrepancies depending on rounding and which figures are used.</p>

  Liquidity Ratios
  <a class="anchor" href="#liquidity-ratios">#</a>
</h3>
<p>To calculate the liquidity ratios for Engineers India Limited for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024, we&rsquo;ll use the standalone financial statement figures. Remember that these ratios will differ from those calculated using consolidated financial statement data.  All values are calculated using figures in Indian Rupees in Lakhs.</p>
<p>First, we need to identify the necessary components from the balance sheet:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Current Assets:</strong> ₹2,59,122.11</li>
<li><strong>Current Liabilities:</strong> ₹2,42,407.83</li>
<li><strong>Inventory:</strong> ₹56.20</li>
<li><strong>Cash and Cash Equivalents:</strong> ₹24,959.66</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, we can calculate the liquidity ratios:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Current Ratio:</strong> This is calculated as Current Assets / Current Liabilities.</p>
<p>₹2,59,122.11 / ₹2,42,407.83 = <strong>1.07</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Quick Ratio (Acid-Test Ratio):</strong> This is calculated as (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities.</p>
<p>(₹2,59,122.11 - ₹56.20) / ₹2,42,407.83 = <strong>1.07</strong> (The inventory value is negligible in this instance, thus there is no significant difference in the current and quick ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cash Ratio:</strong> This is calculated as (Cash and Cash Equivalents) / Current Liabilities.</p>
<p>₹24,959.66 / ₹2,42,407.83 = <strong>0.10</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Note:</strong>  These ratios are based on the standalone balance sheet.  Using the consolidated balance sheet would result in different values.  The ratios provide a snapshot of the company&rsquo;s ability to meet its short-term obligations.  A current ratio above 1 is generally considered favorable, indicating that current assets exceed current liabilities.  However, the interpretation of these ratios should always be done in the context of the company&rsquo;s industry and business model.</p>

  Efficiency Ratios
  <a class="anchor" href="#efficiency-ratios">#</a>
</h3>
<p>To calculate the efficiency ratios for Engineers India Limited for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024, we&rsquo;ll use the standalone financial statement figures.  Remember, these ratios will differ if calculated using the consolidated financial statements.  All calculations use values in Indian Rupees in Lakhs.</p>
<p>First, we need the following data from the financial statements:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Revenue:</strong> ₹3,23,216.50</li>
<li><strong>Average Total Assets:</strong> (₹4,51,189.88 + ₹4,77,144.26) / 2 = ₹4,64,167.07</li>
<li><strong>Average Inventory:</strong> (₹109.03 + ₹56.20) / 2 = ₹82.62 (Note: This is a very rough approximation, using only the year-end values from the standalone statements)</li>
<li><strong>Average Accounts Receivable:</strong> (₹35,294.02 + ₹31,439.35) / 2 = ₹33,366.69 (Net of allowance for credit losses)</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, we can calculate the efficiency ratios:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Asset Turnover:</strong> This measures how efficiently a company uses its assets to generate sales. It&rsquo;s calculated as Revenue / Average Total Assets.</p>
<p>₹3,23,216.50 / ₹4,64,167.07 = <strong>0.70</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Inventory Turnover:</strong> This measures how many times a company sells and replaces its inventory during a period.  It&rsquo;s calculated as Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory.  The annual report does not provide a clear figure for Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) for standalone statements; therefore, it is not possible to calculate the Inventory Turnover Ratio for standalone accounts.  Refer to Consolidated accounts for the same.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Receivables Turnover:</strong> This measures how efficiently a company collects its receivables. It&rsquo;s calculated as Revenue / Average Accounts Receivable.</p>
<p>₹3,23,216.50 / ₹33,366.69 = <strong>9.68</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Note:</strong> These calculations use the standalone figures, which may differ from the consolidated values.  Additionally, the inventory turnover ratio couldn&rsquo;t be calculated due to a lack of necessary standalone data (COGS). The average asset, inventory and accounts receivable values are calculated using only the beginning and ending balances; a more precise calculation would require data for each quarter.  The interpretation of these ratios needs to be considered within the context of EIL&rsquo;s industry and business model.  Lower asset turnover is typical in capital-intensive industries like EIL&rsquo;s.  A higher receivables turnover indicates quicker collection of receivables.</p>
<h3 class="heading" id="leverage-ratios">
  Leverage Ratios
  <a class="anchor" href="#leverage-ratios">#</a>
</h3>
<p>To calculate the use ratios for Engineers India Limited for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024, we will use the standalone financial statement figures.  Remember that these will differ from those calculated using consolidated financial statement data.  All calculations will use figures in Indian Rupees in Lakhs.  However, calculating some ratios proves difficult due to data limitations in the provided standalone report.</p>
<p>First, we need the following data from the standalone financial statements:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Total Debt:</strong> ₹3,608.54 (This represents the sum of lease liabilities and other non-current financial liabilities)</li>
<li><strong>Shareholders&rsquo; Equity:</strong> ₹2,31,127.89</li>
<li><strong>Total Assets:</strong> ₹4,77,144.26</li>
<li><strong>Profit Before Interest and Taxes (PBIT):</strong> This figure is not explicitly provided in the standalone financial statements. We can approximate it using:  PBIT ≈ Profit Before Tax (PBT) + Interest Expense.  From the standalone Statement of Profit and Loss, PBT = ₹47,040.72 lakhs and interest expense (finance costs) = ₹299.53 lakhs.  Therefore, PBIT ≈ ₹47,040.72 lakhs + ₹299.53 lakhs = ₹47,340.25 lakhs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, let&rsquo;s calculate the use ratios:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Debt-to-Equity Ratio:</strong> This measures the proportion of a company&rsquo;s financing that comes from debt relative to equity. It&rsquo;s calculated as Total Debt / Shareholders&rsquo; Equity.</p>
<p>₹3,608.54 / ₹2,31,127.89 = <strong>0.016</strong>  or <strong>1.6%</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Debt-to-Assets Ratio:</strong> This indicates the proportion of a company&rsquo;s assets financed by debt. It&rsquo;s calculated as Total Debt / Total Assets.</p>
<p>₹3,608.54 / ₹4,77,144.26 = <strong>0.0076</strong> or <strong>0.76%</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Interest Coverage Ratio:</strong> This measures a company&rsquo;s ability to pay its interest expenses.  It&rsquo;s calculated as Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT) / Interest Expense.  Using our approximated PBIT value, we can estimate it as follows:</p>
<p>Since PBIT includes interest expense, we will calculate the interest coverage ratio with the help of earnings before interest and tax figure approximated above:  ₹47,340.25 Lakhs/ ₹299.53 Lakhs = <strong>158.02</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Notes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>These calculations rely on the standalone financial statements.  The use of the consolidated financial statements would provide different results.</li>
<li>The Interest Coverage Ratio calculation is an <em>approximation</em> because the standalone statement does not directly provide EBIT.  The PBIT was estimated.  A more precise calculation would require the explicit EBIT figure.</li>
<li>The low debt ratios indicate that EIL has a conservative capital structure with minimal reliance on debt financing.  The high interest coverage ratio reflects a strong ability to meet its interest obligations. However, this needs to be analysed with regard to industry benchmarks.</li>
</ul>
<p>Always remember to interpret these ratios within the context of EIL&rsquo;s industry and business model.  A low debt level is not unusual for a company like EIL, but it’s important to know whether this is appropriate for the sector or indicates other strategic choices about investment or capital acquisition.</p>

  Segment Analysis
  <a class="anchor" href="#segment-analysis">#</a>
</h3>
<p>The Engineers India Limited (EIL) annual report identifies two main business segments:  Consultancy &amp; Engineering and Turnkey Projects.  However, the report does not provide sufficient detail for a complete breakdown of all requested metrics for each segment.  Some data is simply unavailable, while other data requires calculations that are not entirely straightforward due to the structure of the financial reporting.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what we can glean from the report:</p>
<p><strong>1. Consultancy &amp; Engineering:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Name:</strong> Consultancy &amp; Engineering Projects</li>
<li><strong>Revenue (FY2023-24):</strong> ₹1,45,429 lakhs (₹1454.29 crore)</li>
<li><strong>Revenue (FY2022-23):</strong> ₹1,41,791 lakhs (₹1417.91 crore)</li>
<li><strong>Growth Rate (FY2023-24 vs FY2022-23):</strong> Approximately 2.6%</li>
<li><strong>Operating Margin (FY2023-24):</strong>  22.37% (This is calculated by dividing the segment&rsquo;s profit from operations by its revenue: ₹32,531 lakhs / ₹1,45,429 lakhs.  Note this is based only on <em>operating</em> profit; interest, other expenses, taxes and other non-operating items are excluded.)</li>
<li><strong>Operating Margin (FY2022-23):</strong> 27.04%</li>
<li><strong>Market Share:</strong> The report does not provide specific market share data.</li>
<li><strong>Key Products/Services:</strong>  This segment delivers a broad range of engineering consulting and project management services across various sectors, including Upstream Oil and Gas, Pipelines, Petroleum Refining, Petrochemicals, Storage of Crude Oil and Petroleum Products, Metallurgy, Infrastructure, and Airports.</li>
<li><strong>Geographic Presence:</strong> The report indicates a national presence across India, and an international presence in the Middle East, Africa, Southeast Asia, and Latin America.  The breakdown of revenue by region is not provided for this segment alone; the total revenue is presented in the disaggregated revenue table.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Turnkey Projects:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Name:</strong> Turnkey Projects</li>
<li><strong>Revenue (FY2023-24):</strong> ₹1,77,787 lakhs (₹1777.87 crore)</li>
<li><strong>Revenue (FY2022-23):</strong> ₹1,86,585 lakhs (₹1865.85 crore)</li>
<li><strong>Growth Rate (FY2023-24 vs FY2022-23):</strong> Approximately -4.7%</li>
<li><strong>Operating Margin (FY2023-24):</strong> 5.76% (This is calculated by dividing the segment&rsquo;s profit from operations by its revenue: ₹10,242 lakhs / ₹1,77,787 lakhs.  Note this excludes other non-operating items)</li>
<li><strong>Operating Margin (FY2022-23):</strong> 2.79%</li>
<li><strong>Market Share:</strong> The report does not provide specific market share data.</li>
<li><strong>Key Products/Services:</strong> This segment delivers engineering, procurement, and construction management (EPCM) services and Lump Sum Turnkey (LSTK) projects, including refineries, petrochemical plants, and other industrial facilities.</li>
<li><strong>Geographic Presence:</strong> Similar to the Consultancy &amp; Engineering segment, the report indicates both domestic and international presence; the total revenue is presented in the disaggregated revenue table.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Missing Information:</strong></p>
<p>The annual report lacks specific details on market share for both segments and a breakdown of revenue and operating margin by geography within each segment.  It also doesn&rsquo;t break down revenue by specific project or product within the segments. This makes it challenging to provide a more granular analysis.</p>
<p><strong>Overall:</strong></p>
<p>While the report outlines EIL&rsquo;s activities across various sectors,  the presentation of segment-specific data is limited, hindering a more complete analysis. The company&rsquo;s diversification strategy is apparent, but the relative financial success of each area within the broader segments is not fully transparent.</p>

  Audit Information
  <a class="anchor" href="#audit-information">#</a>
</h3>
<p><strong>I. Auditor&rsquo;s Opinion:</strong></p>
<p>The independent auditor&rsquo;s report (Datta Singla &amp; Co.) for the standalone and consolidated financial statements expresses an <strong>unmodified (clean) opinion</strong>.  This means the auditors found the financial statements to present a true and fair view of the company&rsquo;s financial position and performance in accordance with Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) and other generally accepted accounting principles in India.  However, there were two emphasis of matter paragraphs highlighting:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Revenue Recognition from Construction Contracts:</strong> The auditor noted the complexities involved in revenue recognition from long-term construction contracts due to the significant management judgments in assessing contract performance and related estimates.  While the auditor concluded the revenue was appropriately recognized, this was flagged as a key audit matter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Contingent Liabilities:</strong> The auditor highlighted the existence of numerous commercial claims, employee claims, and tax and legal disputes.  The assessment of the potential financial impact of these contingent liabilities involves significant management judgment, which was reviewed by the auditor.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These emphasis-of-matter paragraphs do <em>not</em> modify the auditor&rsquo;s overall unmodified opinion, but draw attention to significant areas of judgment and estimation involved in the preparation of the financial statements.</p>
<p><strong>II. Key Accounting Policies:</strong></p>
<p>The annual report outlines many key accounting policies employed by Engineers India Limited (EIL).  Key aspects include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Revenue Recognition:</strong> Revenue from contracts with customers is recognized over time based on the percentage of completion method for long-term contracts, and when control of services is transferred to the customer for other contracts.  Significant management judgment is involved in estimating the percentage of completion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Intangible Assets:</strong>  Software is capitalized and amortized over three years (or immediately if the cost is less than ₹5 lakhs).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Property, Plant, and Equipment (PPE):</strong> PPE is recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method, based on the useful lives of the assets.  Capital work-in-progress is accounted for separately.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Leases:</strong>  EIL follows IFRS 16 and accounts for leases as either operating or finance leases.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Investment Properties:</strong>  These are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment.  Independent valuations are obtained annually.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Foreign Currency:</strong> Transactions and balances are recorded at the exchange rate prevailing on the transaction date or balance sheet date, respectively, and exchange differences are recognized in profit or loss.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Impairment of Assets:</strong> Both financial and non-financial assets are tested for impairment when indicators suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Financial Instruments:</strong>  Financial assets are classified and measured based on their business model and contractual terms as Fair Value Through Profit or Loss (FVTPL), Fair Value Through Other Detailed Income (FVTOCI), or Amortized Cost.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Government Grants:</strong>  These are recognized when there is reasonable assurance of receipt and compliance with conditions. Revenue grants reduce related expenses, while grants related to assets are recognized as deferred income.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Oil and Gas Exploration Activities:</strong>  The &ldquo;successful efforts method&rdquo; is used for accounting for these activities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Income Taxes:</strong>  Both current and deferred taxes are recognized using the liability method.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Employee Benefits:</strong>  Defined contribution plans (like Provident Fund) are expensed when the services are rendered. Defined benefit plans (like gratuity and post-retirement medical benefits) are accounted for using actuarial valuations.  Significant judgments and estimations are involved in determining the defined benefit obligations.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These policies are applied consistently across the standalone and consolidated financial statements, except where indicated.  The report emphasizes the role of management judgment and estimation in many of these key areas, especially revenue recognition, impairment, and the valuation of contingent liabilities.  The independent auditor&rsquo;s report highlights the importance of the management&rsquo;s judgment and estimates used for preparing the financial statements.</p>
