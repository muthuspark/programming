  Scenario Analysis and Sensitivity to Key Assumptions
  <a class="anchor" href="#scenario-analysis-and-sensitivity-to-key-assumptions">#</a>
</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Geopolitical Situation:</strong> The current geopolitical situation is assessed to be conducive for increased defense spending.</li>
<li><strong>Revenue Growth Scenario:</strong> Continued increase in revenue from operations is expected, with a target close to ₹10,000-₹10,500 crore for an &ldquo;excellent&rdquo; MoU rating in FY25.
<ul>
<li><em>Sensitivity:</em> Growth is highly sensitive to the timely materialization of orders, particularly the additional submarine order.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Profitability Scenario:</strong> Margins are influenced by early deliveries (positive impact), liquidated damages (negative impact), and the type of contracts (nomination vs. competitive).
<ul>
<li><em>Sensitivity:</em> EBITDA margins have been volatile, and future margins will depend heavily on project execution and contract type.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Order Book Scenario:</strong> Strong order book (₹38,561 crore as of March 31, 2024), but future growth depends on securing new orders, especially the additional submarine contract.
<ul>
<li><em>Sensitivity:</em> A significant increase in the order book is expected if the submarine contract materializes; otherwise, growth will depend on smaller orders.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Capex Impact Scenario:</strong> Significant Capex is planned, particularly for land acquisition and Nhava yard development.
<ul>
<li><em>Sensitivity:</em> Cash reserves will be utilized, impacting free cash flow. Funding for new projects could be impacted if major new orders are delayed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Competition Scenario:</strong> MDL anticipates potentially bidding for next-generation destroyers (NGD) and follow-on P-17 Bravo frigates, but the tender process is uncertain.</li>
<li><strong>Cost Sensitivity:</strong> Profitability is sensitive to project cost management, where early deliveries have a positive effect by saving on costs.</li>
