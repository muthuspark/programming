<p>This analysis examines the MSWIL Annual Report for the fiscal year 2023-24, covering financial performance, business segments, risks, and ESG initiatives.</p>
<p><strong>I. Financial Performance:</strong></p>
<p>MSWIL demonstrated strong financial growth in FY2023-24, exceeding its targets. Key highlights include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Revenue from Operations:</strong> INR 83,282 million (USD 1 billion), an 18% increase compared to FY2022-23 (INR 70,680 million).  This outpaced the overall Indian automotive market growth.</li>
<li><strong>EBITDA:</strong> INR 10,133 million (USD 122 million), a significant 27% increase year-on-year.  The EBITDA margin improved to 10.4% from 11.3% in the previous year.</li>
<li><strong>PAT:</strong> INR 6,383 million (USD 77 million), a 31.1% increase year-on-year.</li>
<li><strong>ROCE:</strong> 48%, exceeding the targeted 40%. This indicates efficient utilization of capital employed.</li>
<li><strong>Debt:</strong> The company remained debt-free as of March 31, 2024, highlighting its strong financial position.</li>
<li><strong>Dividend Payout:</strong> 55% of profits after tax, amounting to INR 0.80 per share.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key Financial Ratios:</strong></p>
<p>The report provides many key ratios, indicating strong financial health and operational efficiency:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Trade Receivable Turnover (days):</strong> 37 days (relatively stable compared to the previous year).</li>
<li><strong>Inventory Turnover (days):</strong> 78 days (improved efficiency compared to 84 days in the previous year).</li>
<li><strong>Return on Equity:</strong> 42% (slightly improved).</li>
<li><strong>Interest Coverage Ratio:</strong> 37.12 times (significant improvement, indicating robust profitability).</li>
<li><strong>Current Ratio:</strong> 1.94 times (improved liquidity).</li>
<li><strong>Debt-to-Equity Ratio:</strong> 0.15 times (significantly reduced debt compared to the previous year).</li>
<li><strong>Net Debt/EBITDA:</strong> 0.09 times (a substantial improvement, reflecting a strong financial position).</li>
<li><strong>Operating Profit Margin:</strong> 10.4% (slightly improved).</li>
<li><strong>Net Profit Margin:</strong> 7.7% (improved).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>II. Business Segments:</strong></p>
<p>MSWIL&rsquo;s revenue is primarily generated from supplying wiring harnesses and related components to automotive OEMs in India. The report breaks down the revenue by vehicle type:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Passenger Vehicles (PVs):</strong> 58% of revenue.  Growth is driven by increasing demand for SUVs and the premiumization trend (more advanced features requiring more complex wiring harnesses).</li>
<li><strong>Commercial Vehicles (CVs):</strong> 12% of revenue.</li>
<li><strong>Two-Wheelers (2Ws):</strong> 14% of revenue.</li>
<li><strong>O/ff-Road &amp; Agricultural Vehicles:</strong> 10% of revenue.</li>
<li><strong>Others:</strong> 6% of revenue (including Tier 1/2 suppliers).</li>
</ul>
<p>MSWIL is strategically positioned to benefit from many key industry trends:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Premiumization:</strong>  Increasing demand for advanced safety features, connectivity, and infotainment systems in vehicles.</li>
<li><strong>Electric Mobility:</strong>  Growing demand for specialized high-voltage wiring harnesses for EVs and hybrid vehicles.  MSWIL is actively investing in R&amp;D and new manufacturing lines to cater to this segment.</li>
<li><strong>Alternative Powertrains:</strong>  The company is developing solutions for CNG and flex-fuel vehicles.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>III. Risks:</strong></p>
<p>The annual report identifies many key risks:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Market Risk:</strong> Fluctuations in commodity prices (especially copper), currency exchange rates, and overall automotive market demand.  The company mitigates this through pass-through pricing mechanisms with customers and a focus on localization.</li>
<li><strong>Supply Chain Disruptions:</strong>  Global supply chain vulnerabilities and potential material shortages.  Mitigation strategies include localization, strategic sourcing, and supplier diversification.</li>
<li><strong>Technological Change:</strong> The rapid pace of technological advancement in the automotive industry requires continuous R&amp;D and adaptation.</li>
<li><strong>Regulatory Changes:</strong>  Changes in environmental regulations and safety standards.</li>
<li><strong>Geopolitical Risks:</strong> Global political instability and economic downturns.</li>
<li><strong>Human Capital Risk:</strong> Attracting and retaining skilled employees, ensuring workplace safety and promoting diversity &amp; inclusion.</li>
<li><strong>Financial Risk:</strong> Maintaining optimal capital structure and liquidity.</li>
<li><strong>ESG Risks:</strong> Failure to meet evolving stakeholder expectations on Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) matters.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>IV. ESG Initiatives:</strong></p>
<p>MSWIL demonstrates a commitment to sustainability across three key pillars: Planet, People, and Governance.</p>
<p><strong>A. Planet:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Carbon Net Zero Target:</strong>  Ambitious goal to achieve carbon neutrality by 2040.  Initiatives include increased renewable energy (solar and wind power), energy efficiency improvements (LED lighting, motion sensors, etc.), and a &lsquo;Turn Off, Turn Down&rsquo; energy conservation campaign.</li>
<li><strong>Water Conservation:</strong> Aiming for water-preservation systems in all facilities by 2030.  Initiatives include rainwater harvesting, efficient water usage systems, and sewage treatment plants.</li>
<li><strong>Waste Management:</strong>  Focus on circularity through food waste recycling (Aerobins), paper reduction, and partnering with Padcare Labs for sanitary napkin recycling.</li>
<li><strong>ISO Certifications:</strong> All units are ISO 14001 (environmental management) certified, and the company is working towards ISO 50001 (energy management) certification.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>B. People:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Employee Well-being:</strong>  Various initiatives to promote employee health, safety, and well-being, including training programs, mental health workshops, safety awareness campaigns, and celebration of diversity.</li>
<li><strong>Skill Development:</strong>  Significant investment in skill-upgradation programs through dedicated skill development centers and e-learning platforms.</li>
<li><strong>Safety:</strong>  All facilities are ISO 45001 certified, and the company maintains a robust safety management system with regular safety audits and training programs.  LTIFR rates are reported.</li>
<li><strong>Diversity &amp; Inclusion:</strong>  Commitment to building a various and inclusive workplace.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>C. Governance:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Board-level Sustainability Committee:</strong> Oversees sustainability strategies and initiatives.</li>
<li><strong>Unit-level Sustainability Champions:</strong>  Drive sustainability implementation at the facility level.</li>
<li><strong>Ethical Practices:</strong>  Emphasis on ethical conduct, transparency, and accountability through a Code of Conduct, Whistleblower Policy, and robust internal controls.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>V. Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>MSWIL&rsquo;s annual report showcases robust financial performance, strategic alignment with key industry trends, and a strong commitment to ESG principles. The company&rsquo;s focus on innovation, localization, and customer relationships positions it for continued growth.  However, potential risks related to market volatility, supply chain disruptions, and the transition to electric vehicles need to be continuously monitored and addressed.  The ambitious ESG targets set by the company demonstrate a proactive approach to sustainability, but the success of these initiatives will depend on their effective implementation and monitoring.  The report provides a good overview of the company&rsquo;s performance and outlook, although with limited depth in some areas.  Further detail on specific ESG metrics and future plans would improve the transparency and usefulness of the report for investors and other stakeholders.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Revenue:</strong> INR 83,351 million (This includes Revenue from Operations (INR 83,282 million) and Other Income (INR 69 million).  The slight discrepancy is likely due to rounding.)</li>
<li><strong>Cost of Revenue:</strong> INR 74,896 million (This is the sum of the individual expense items listed in the statement of profit and loss; Cost of Raw Material Consumed, Changes in Inventories, Employee Benefits Expense, Depreciation Expense, Finance Costs, and Other Expenses)</li>

<li><strong>Operating Expenses:</strong> INR 74,896 million - 8,455 million = INR 66,441 million (This is an indirect calculation; operating expenses are not explicitly listed as a separate line item).  This comprises the Cost of Raw Material Consumed, Changes in Inventories, Employee Benefits Expense, Depreciation Expense, and Other Expenses.</li>
<li><strong>Operating Income:</strong> INR 8,455 million (This is the same as Gross Profit as finance costs are not deducted)</li>

<li><strong>EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization):</strong> INR 10,133 million  (Note this figure is derived from the Statement of Profit and Loss by adding back depreciation, interest expense, and taxes to the profit before tax, and subtracting interest income).</li>
<li><strong>Basic EPS (Earnings Per Share):</strong> INR 1.44</li>
<li><strong>Diluted EPS (Earnings Per Share):</strong> INR 1.44 (The same as basic EPS because there are no dilutive potential equity shares.)</li>

<h3 class="heading" id="cash-flow-components">
  Cash Flow Components
  <a class="anchor" href="#cash-flow-components">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Based on the MSWIL Cash Flow Statement:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cash Flow from Operating Activities:</strong> INR 7,910 million</li>
<li><strong>Cash Flow from Investing Activities:</strong> (INR 2,079) million  (The negative sign indicates a net cash outflow)</li>
<li><strong>Cash Flow from Financing Activities:</strong> (INR 4,522) million (The negative sign indicates a net cash outflow)</li>
</ul>
<p>All figures are in Indian Rupees (INR) and rounded to the nearest million.  The parentheses around the negative numbers indicate cash outflows.</p>
<h3 class="heading" id="cash-flow-metrics">
  Cash Flow Metrics
  <a class="anchor" href="#cash-flow-metrics">#</a>
</h3>
<p>The MSWIL annual report doesn&rsquo;t explicitly state &ldquo;Free Cash Flow&rdquo; as a separate line item.  However, we can calculate an approximation:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Capital Expenditure (CAPEX):</strong> INR 1,111 million (This is directly stated in the cash flow statement)</li>
<li><strong>Dividends Paid:</strong> INR 2,868 million (This is directly stated in the cash flow statement)</li>
</ul>
<p>To approximate Free Cash Flow (FCF), we can use the following formula:</p>
<p>FCF ≈  Cash Flow from Operating Activities - Capital Expenditures</p>
<p>Therefore, an <em>approximation</em> of MSWIL&rsquo;s Free Cash Flow would be:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Approximated Free Cash Flow:</strong> INR 7,910 million - INR 1,111 million = INR 6,799 million</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Note:</strong> This is an approximation.  A precise FCF calculation would require adjustments for changes in working capital not already reflected in the cash flow from operations figure.  Also, the definition of FCF can vary slightly depending on the context.  The report doesn&rsquo;t provide sufficient detail to perform a completely accurate FCF calculation.</p>

  Profitability Ratios
  <a class="anchor" href="#profitability-ratios">#</a>
</h3>
<p>To calculate the profitability ratios for Motherson Sumi Wiring India Limited (MSWIL), we need to use the figures from the Statement of Profit and Loss and Balance Sheet.  Remember, all figures are in INR millions unless otherwise noted.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Gross Profit Margin:</strong> (Gross Profit / Revenue) * 100</p>
<p>Gross Profit = Revenue - Cost of Revenue = 83,351 - 74,896 = 8,455
Gross Profit Margin = (8,455 / 83,351) * 100 ≈ 10.1%</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Operating Profit Margin:</strong> (Operating Income / Revenue) * 100</p>
<p>Operating Income =  8,455 (This is considered the operating income because finance costs are not deducted from the gross profit)
Operating Profit Margin = (8,455 / 83,351) * 100 ≈ 10.1%</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Net Profit Margin:</strong> (Net Income / Revenue) * 100</p>
<p>Net Income = 6,383
Net Profit Margin = (6,383 / 83,351) * 100 ≈ 7.6%</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Return on Equity (ROE):</strong> (Net Income / Average Shareholders&rsquo; Equity) * 100</p>
<p>Net Income = 6,383
Average Shareholders&rsquo; Equity = (13,305 + 16,768) / 2 = 15,036.5
ROE = (6,383 / 15,036.5) * 100 ≈ 42.4%</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Return on Assets (ROA):</strong> (Net Income / Average Total Assets) * 100</p>
<p>Net Income = 6,383
Average Total Assets = (28,977 + 31,389) / 2 = 30,183
ROA = (6,383 / 30,183) * 100 ≈ 21.1%</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Note:</strong> These calculations are based on the figures provided in the annual report.  Slight variations may occur due to rounding differences in the report itself.  Furthermore, the calculation of operating income assumes that finance costs are not included in operating expenses; this should be confirmed from the company&rsquo;s accounting practices.</p>
<h3 class="heading" id="liquidity-ratios">
  Liquidity Ratios
  <a class="anchor" href="#liquidity-ratios">#</a>
</h3>
<p>To calculate the liquidity ratios for Motherson Sumi Wiring India Limited (MSWIL), we&rsquo;ll use the figures from the Balance Sheet. Remember, all figures are in INR millions.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Current Ratio:</strong> Current Assets / Current Liabilities</p>
<p>Current Assets = 23,767
Current Liabilities = 12,030  (Note: There&rsquo;s a discrepancy between the sum of current liabilities in the detailed breakdown vs. the total provided. We&rsquo;ll use the total of 12,030 for this calculation.  This discrepancy should be noted.)
Current Ratio = 23,767 / 12,030 ≈ 1.97</p>

<li>
<p><strong>Quick Ratio (Acid-Test Ratio):</strong> (Current Assets - Inventories) / Current Liabilities</p>
<p>Current Assets = 23,767
Inventories = 11,399
Current Liabilities = 12,030
Quick Ratio = (23,767 - 11,399) / 12,030 ≈ 1.02</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cash Ratio:</strong> (Cash and Cash Equivalents) / Current Liabilities</p>
<p>Cash and Cash Equivalents = 1,670
Current Liabilities = 12,030
Cash Ratio = 1,670 / 12,030 ≈ 0.14</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Notes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>All figures are rounded to two decimal places.</li>
<li>The current ratio is significantly higher than the quick ratio, indicating a substantial portion of current assets is tied up in inventory.</li>
<li>The cash ratio is low, suggesting that the company may rely more heavily on other current assets to meet short-term obligations.</li>
<li>As noted previously, there&rsquo;s a discrepancy in the current liabilities figure in the provided balance sheet.

</h3>
<p>To calculate the efficiency ratios for Motherson Sumi Wiring India Limited (MSWIL), we&rsquo;ll use figures from the Statement of Profit and Loss and the Balance Sheet.  Remember, all figures are in INR millions.  We&rsquo;ll need to make some assumptions and approximations due to missing information in the provided excerpts.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Asset Turnover:</strong> Revenue / Average Total Assets</p>
<p>Revenue = 83,351
Average Total Assets = (28,977 + 31,389) / 2 = 30,183
Asset Turnover = 83,351 / 30,183 ≈ 2.76</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Inventory Turnover:</strong> Cost of Revenue / Average Inventory</p>
<p>Cost of Revenue = 74,896
Average Inventory = (12,096 + 11,399) / 2 = 11,747.5
Inventory Turnover = 74,896 / 11,747.5 ≈ 6.37</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Receivables Turnover:</strong> Revenue / Average Accounts Receivable</p>
<p>Revenue = 83,351
Average Accounts Receivable = (8,004 + 8,959) / 2 = 8,481.5
Receivables Turnover = 83,351 / 8,481.5 ≈ 9.83</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Notes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>All figures are rounded to two decimal places.</li>
<li>These calculations are based on the available data in the annual report.  Slight variations might occur depending on the rounding in the original financial statements.  There may also be further refinement needed depending on whether the revenue figure used incorporates other income or only revenue from operations.</li>
<li>The inventory turnover ratio suggests that the company sells and replaces its inventory approximately 6.37 times per year.  The receivables turnover shows that the company collects its outstanding receivables approximately 9.83 times per year, which correlates with the average collection period (days) of 37 days as reported.  The asset turnover indicates that the company generates INR 2.76 in revenue for every INR 1 in total assets.  These metrics would need further comparison to industry benchmarks for more meaningful analysis.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Debt-to-Equity Ratio:</strong> Total Debt / Shareholders&rsquo; Equity</p>
<p>Total Debt =  Long-term debt + Current portion of Lease Liabilities = 86 + 737 = 823 (Note: This calculation uses the figures from the balance sheet. The definition of total debt might be different in the company&rsquo;s accounting practices, depending on inclusion/exclusion of other liabilities. Also note the earlier discrepancy in current liabilities reporting should be investigated for accuracy)
Shareholders&rsquo; Equity = 16,768
Debt-to-Equity Ratio = 823 / 16,768 ≈ 0.05</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Debt-to-Assets Ratio:</strong> Total Debt / Total Assets</p>
<p>Total Debt = 823
Total Assets = 31,389
Debt-to-Assets Ratio = 823 / 31,389 ≈ 0.03</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Interest Coverage Ratio:</strong> EBITDA / Interest Expense</p>
<p>EBITDA = 10,133
Interest Expense = 273 (This is the net finance cost as reported in the statement of profit and loss. It excludes interest income and should be adjusted to only include interest expense)
Interest Coverage Ratio = 10,133 / 273 ≈ 37.11</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Notes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>All figures are rounded to two decimal places.</li>
<li>There is ambiguity in the balance sheet in relation to total debt. It lists total lease liability separately. The calculations above use the figures listed as &ldquo;Borrowings&rdquo;, as per the balance sheet. This should be clarified from the company&rsquo;s accounting practices.  The definition of &ldquo;Total Debt&rdquo; can vary significantly depending on what liabilities are included (e.g., lease obligations, etc.) therefore requiring clarification.</li>
<li>A higher interest coverage ratio is generally preferred, indicating the company&rsquo;s ability to easily meet its interest obligations.</li>
<li>The low debt-to-equity and debt-to-assets ratios suggest that the company has a conservative capital structure with low reliance on debt financing.  This should be compared to industry benchmarks for a more complete interpretation.</li>

  Segment Analysis
  <a class="anchor" href="#segment-analysis">#</a>
</h3>
<p>The MSWIL annual report does not provide a detailed breakdown of business segments with precise revenue figures, growth rates, operating margins, and market shares for each segment.  The report offers a general overview of revenue distribution by vehicle type, but doesn&rsquo;t provide segment-specific profitability or market share data.  This limits the ability to perform a thorough analysis on a segment-by-segment basis.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a summary based on the information available:</p>
<p><strong>Business Segments (by Vehicle Type):</strong></p>
<p>The report categorizes MSWIL&rsquo;s business based on the type of vehicle the wiring harnesses are supplied for.  While these are not formally defined as separate segments for accounting purposes (the report indicates that only one segment is reported), they provide a useful classification:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Passenger Vehicles (PVs):</strong> This is the largest segment, contributing 58% of revenue. Key products are wiring harnesses of varying complexity, tailored to different models and features (including advanced safety and infotainment systems). The growth is driven by the overall growth in the Indian passenger vehicle market, especially SUVs, and the trend of premiumization.  Specific revenue, growth rate, operating margin, and market share are not provided.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Commercial Vehicles (CVs):</strong> This segment represents 12% of revenue.  Products include wiring harnesses for buses and light-duty trucks.  The growth rate, margin and market share are not detailed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Two-Wheelers (2Ws):</strong> This segment constitutes 14% of revenue, supplying wiring harnesses to two-wheeler manufacturers. Again, more detailed segment data is not presented.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>O/ff-Road &amp; Agricultural Vehicles:</strong> This segment accounts for 10% of revenue, providing wiring harnesses for specialized vehicles.  The report does not provide further segment data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Others:</strong> This category includes 6% of revenue, covering sales to other Tier 1/2 suppliers or other miscellaneous business areas.  Details are absent.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Missing Information:</strong></p>
<p>The report lacks essential data for a complete segment analysis:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Precise Revenue Figures:</strong> Only the overall revenue distribution percentages by vehicle type are provided;  exact revenue figures for each category aren&rsquo;t given.</li>
<li><strong>Growth Rates:</strong> Year-on-year growth rates for each segment are not disclosed.</li>
<li><strong>Operating Margins:</strong>  Profitability (operating margins) for individual segments is not reported.</li>
<li><strong>Market Shares:</strong> The company&rsquo;s market share in each of these vehicle segments is not provided.</li>
<li><strong>Geographic Presence:</strong> While the report mentions that MSWIL has 26 plants across India, it doesn&rsquo;t break down the geographic distribution of these facilities among the segments.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>Without detailed segmental financial data, a precise analysis of MSWIL&rsquo;s performance across di/fferent vehicle categories is impossible based solely on the provided report. The available information only gives a high-level overview of revenue distribution but lacks essential metrics to evaluate individual segment performance and profitability.</p>

</h3>
<p><strong>Auditor&rsquo;s Opinion:</strong></p>
<p>The auditor&rsquo;s opinion, provided by S.R. Batliboi &amp; Co. LLP, is unqualified (i.e., a clean opinion).  The auditors stated that the financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in India, of the Company&rsquo;s financial position, financial performance (including other detailed income), cash flows, and changes in equity.  The report also includes a section on key audit matters, focusing on the significance of related-party transactions and the judgements involved in their assessment. A separate report was issued on the internal financial controls, which also received an unqualified opinion.</p>
<p><strong>Key Accounting Policies:</strong></p>
<p>Several key accounting policies are highlighted in the notes to the financial statements:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Revenue Recognition:</strong> Revenue from contracts with customers is recognized when control of goods or services transfers to the customer.  The company assesses whether it is acting as a principal or an agent in each transaction, impacting how revenue is recognized (gross vs. net).  Judgements are applied regarding the lease term, significant financing components in contracts, variable consideration (rights of return, volume rebates), and warranty obligations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Financial Instruments:</strong>  Financial assets are classified and measured at amortized cost, fair value through other detailed income (FVOCI), or fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) based on the business model and cash flow characteristics.  The expected credit loss (ECL) model is used for impairment of financial assets.  Financial liabilities are classified similarly and measured at amortized cost or fair value through profit or loss.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Property, Plant, and Equipment (PP&amp;E):</strong> PP&amp;E is recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment.  Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the asset&rsquo;s useful life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Borrowing Costs:</strong> Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition or construction of assets are capitalized; others are expensed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Inventories:</strong> Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost is determined using a weighted average cost method.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Government Grants:</strong>  Recognized at fair value when there is reasonable assurance of receipt and compliance with conditions.  Grants related to income are deferred and recognized over the related period; grants related to assets are recognized in profit or loss over the asset&rsquo;s useful life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Leases:</strong> The company follows Ind AS 116, recognizing right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for all leases except short-term and low-value leases.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Employee Benefits:</strong> Short-term benefits are recognized at the expected cost at the end of the reporting period; defined contribution plans are expensed when contributions are made; defined benefit plans use actuarial valuations, with remeasurements going to OCI.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Income Taxes:</strong> The Company uses the liability method for deferred tax, recognizing assets and liabilities when it is probable that future taxable profit or loss will arise.  Current tax liabilities are based on tax rates at the end of the reporting period.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Fair Value Measurement:</strong>  The company uses a three-level hierarchy to categorize fair value measurements (Level 1: quoted prices; Level 2: observable inputs; Level 3: unobservable inputs).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These are some of the key accounting policies. The notes to the financial statements contain more detail on these and other accounting policies.</p>
