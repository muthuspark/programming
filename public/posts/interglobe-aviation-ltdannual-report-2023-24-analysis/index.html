</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Severity:</strong> High, due to the potential impact on the Company&rsquo;s long-term growth plans, including expansion into new markets and the introduction of wide-body aircraft (A350-900 order).</li>
<li><strong>Likelihood:</strong> Medium. Market under-penetration in India presents growth opportunities, but competition and global economic factors introduce uncertainties.</li>
<li><strong>Trend:</strong> Increasing. IndiGo&rsquo;s strategy of &lsquo;Towards new heights and across new frontiers&rsquo; and plans to double in size by 2030, signals an increasing focus on strategic risk management. Also, the stated entry into the widebody space represents a change.</li>
<li><strong>Mitigation Strategies:</strong> Diversification of routes (domestic and international), strategic partnerships (codeshare agreements with Turkish Airlines, Qantas), fleet expansion, and investment in technology and customer experience.</li>
<li><strong>Control Effectiveness:</strong> Partially effective, as evidenced by a 26.6% growth in revenue from operations and a positive profit after tax. However, the stated tailwinds in OTP in the bad weather months demonstrate a partial effectiveness.</li>
<li><strong>Potential Financial Impact:</strong> Significant. IndiGo&rsquo;s highest-ever annual total income of â¹712 billion and a net profit of â¹82 billion are directly tied to its strategic decisions.</li>

</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Severity:</strong> High. Supply-chain issues impacting the availability of spare engines for NEO P&amp;W GTF-powered aircraft are directly impacting operations.</li>
<li><strong>Likelihood:</strong> High. Engine issues are ongoing, and &ldquo;fog&rdquo; weather are explicitly mentioned as a factor, combined with high aircraft utilization, shows a operational performance impact.</li>
<li><strong>Trend:</strong> Stable to Increasing. Ongoing supply chain constraints, and a growing fleet (adding more than one aircraft every week in FY2025), indicating a need for enhanced operational risk management.</li>
<li><strong>Mitigation Strategies:</strong> Lease extensions, damp leases, induction of used aircraft, and close collaboration with OEMs and engine manufacturers. Operational Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) reviews and evolving of digital solutions are in place.</li>
<li><strong>Control Effectiveness:</strong> Mixed. Operational performance resulted to 107 million customers, a 25% growth vs. FY 2023. IndiGo was able to maintain technical dispatch reliability of 99.9%. Despite the challenges, they achieved six quarters of consecutive profitability. OTP was negatively impacted during IROPS.</li>

</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Severity:</strong> Medium to high. The aviation sector faces ESG risks that may require airlines to invest in modern generation aircraft, and use blends of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).</li>
<li><strong>Likelihood:</strong> Medium. IndiGo recognizes the limited availability of SAF, and uncertainty in sufficient and feasible supply.</li>
<li><strong>Trend:</strong> Increasing. The BRSR report is evidence of an increasing trend.</li>
<li><strong>Mitigation Strategies:</strong> IndiGo has reduced emissions by 19% vs. FY 2016. The adoption of innovative nozzles can reduce on-board water consumption by 98%. 100% fleet of eco-friendly electric coaches in Ahmedabad.</li>
<li><strong>Control Effectiveness:</strong> Partially effective. IndiGo is in discussions with oil marketing companies regarding SAF. Also, 86% of the fleet is compliant with Chapter 14 noise standards set by ICAO.</li>
<li><strong>Potential Financial Impact.</strong> Medium to high. SAF may be available at a significantly higher cost.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Fuel Price Sensitivity:</strong> Aircraft fuel expenses represent a significant portion of total costs. Management continuously monitors the fuel prices for implementing fuel-efficient practices.</li>
<li><strong>Foreign Exchange Rate Sensitivity:</strong> Adverse movements in foreign exchange rates (particularly USD) can significantly impact profitability due to foreign currency-denominated costs (aircraft and engine lease rentals, maintenance, and insurance). The Group is partially hedged from foreign currency deposits. A 1% depreciation/appreciation of the Indian Rupee against the USD would impact profit/loss by Rs. 4,977.98 million.</li>
<li><strong>Interest Rate Sensitivity:</strong> A reasonably possible change of 0.50% in interest rates at the reporting date would have impacted profit/loss by approximately Rs. (299.57) to 299.57 million.</li>
<li><strong>Aircraft Maintenance Obligations Sensitivity:</strong> A 10% difference in the expected cost of maintenance could impact the provision by Rs. 2,253.33 million. A 1% change in the discount rate could impact the provision by Rs 250.87 to (211.82) million.</li>
