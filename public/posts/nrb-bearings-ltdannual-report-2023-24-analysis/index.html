</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Growth Initiatives:</strong> Focus on component categories with higher margins, development of components for EVs, and expansion into adjacent industries.</li>
<li><strong>Challenges:</strong> Shifting market dynamics, changing OEM needs, technological disruptions (e.g., EVs), evolving regulatory environment, and the presence of spurious/counterfeit products in the market. A fire incident at the Waluj Plant impacted operations.</li>
<li><strong>Risk Identified</strong>: Business continuity, changes in technology, Procurements of raw materials and supply chain.</li>

  Strategic Risks
  <a class="anchor" href="#strategic-risks">#</a>
</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Severity:</strong> High, due to the fire incident impacting a major auto-product assembly line and the evolving automotive market towards EVs.</li>
<li><strong>Likelihood:</strong> Moderate. Market shifts and unforeseen events like the fire incident present ongoing risk.</li>
<li><strong>Trend:</strong> Increasing, with the growing adoption of EVs and changing customer preferences.</li>
<li><strong>Mitigation Strategies:</strong> Focus on components not likely to be replaced by EV, new EV products, expansion into adjacent industries, operational efficiency improvement, process improvement, and investment in R&amp;D for new products.</li>
<li><strong>Control Effectiveness:</strong> Partially effective. Mitigation strategies are in place, but the fire incident indicates vulnerability.</li>
<li><strong>Potential Financial Impact:</strong> Revenue from the two-wheeler segment was adversely impacted. Overall revenue increased by only 3.49% on a consolidated basis, indicating potential stagnation. Net profit increased significantly, but mainly attributed to a one-time exceptional gains, such as income from the sale of land and building, sale of investment in subsidiary company and insurance claim receipts from the fire incident.</li>

  Operational Risks
  <a class="anchor" href="#operational-risks">#</a>
</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Severity:</strong> High, highlighted by the fire incident at the Waluj plant causing damage to the auto-product assembly line, ready components, stores, and spares.</li>
<li><strong>Likelihood:</strong> Moderate. Cordial relations with workmen&rsquo;s unions are mentioned, but incidents like the Waluj fire are possible.</li>
<li><strong>Trend:</strong> Stable, assuming mitigation strategies are implemented effectively.</li>
<li><strong>Mitigation Strategies:</strong> Adequate insurance coverage, risk management framework to identify and minimize risks, focus on safety and environmental awareness, and implementation of safety measures like ETP upgradation, water conservation and energy conservation activities.</li>
<li><strong>Control Effectiveness:</strong> Moderate, with systems like ISO 14001:2015, ISO 45001:2018, and IATF16949:2016 certifications, but the fire incident demonstrated vulnerability.</li>
<li><strong>Potential Financial Impact:</strong> The fire led to a recorded impairment loss (net) of ₹2,076 lakhs. The insurance claim received was ₹3,051 lakhs.</li>

</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Severity:</strong> Moderate.</li>

<li><strong>Trend:</strong> Decreasing for some risks (e.g. debt levels) and increasing for other risks (e.g. change in raw material prices).</li>
<li><strong>Mitigation Strategies:</strong> Judicious working capital management, operational efficiencies, focus on receivables and inventory, hedging against foreign currency fluctuations through derivative instruments.</li>
<li><strong>Control effectivness</strong>: the debt-equity ratio improved significantly from 0.46 to 0.14, indicating a reduction in financial leverage.</li>
