  <meta property="og:description" content="Earnings Call Transcript Analysis Report # Financial Performance # Key Financial Metrics # Disbursements: INR 1,879 crores (flat compared to expectations of INR 2,300-2,400 crores). AUM Growth: 9% for the first three quarters. Gross NPA: 0.92% (slight increase). Provisioning: Increased, but expected to be marginal in Q4. Credit cost guided at 15 bps for the year. Yield on Books: 10.14% for 9 months (up from 10.12% in the previous quarter). Cost of Borrowing: Down by 2 bps for 9 months. Spread: Marginally improved, guidance maintained at 2.5%. NIM: Guidance maintained at 3.5%. ROE: Expected to close at 17%&#43; for the year. ROA: Expected to close at 2.1%&#43; for the year. Cost-to-Income ratio: Marginally came down. Comparison with Previous Periods # Disbursements were flat compared to Q2, significantly below the projected 5-10% growth. Yield improved slightly (2 bps) compared to the last quarter. Cost of borrowing decreased by 2 bps compared to the last 9 months. SMA Stage 2 remained relatively stable. Slight Increase on SMA 0. Revised Guidance/Forecasts # Q4 disbursements expected to be “marginally in the range” of Q4 of the previous year. Spread and NIM guidance maintained at 2.5% and 3.5%, respectively. ROE and ROA targets maintained at 17%&#43; and 2.1%&#43;, respectively. FY26 Guidance. 15bps credit costs. Cost-to-income ratio approximately 18-18.5%. FY26 dispersement target INR 12,000 crores. Areas of Growth/Decline # Disbursement growth was negatively impacted by issues in Karnataka (e-khata) and Telangana. Positive growth was seen in North, Rajasthan, Gujarat, and Tamil Nadu. Yield on advances improved due to a focus on SENP and LAP products. Cost of borrowing was reduced due to a shift to repo rate/T-bill linked loans and NHB funding. Strategic Initiatives &amp; Business Updates # Major Strategic Announcements # Finalized a major IT transformation project with IBM, to be implemented in Q3 of the next financial year (October-December 2025). New Products/Services/Markets # Opened up the LAP (Loan Against Property) product to new customers (previously only for existing customers). Increased focus on the SENP (Self-Employed Non-Professional) segment. Operational Changes # Shifted all bank borrowings to be linked to either repo rate or T-bills (no MCLR-linked borrowings). Raised INR 1,600 crores from NHB at a lower rate (7.6%). Reviewed and closed/merged 10 branches, opening 10 new branches in different geographies. 15 new branches are in the pipeline. Strengthened internal assurance functions. Ongoing/Completed Projects # IT transformation project with IBM is the major ongoing project. Market &amp; Competitive Landscape # Industry Trends # Some lenders report volume declines, with growth driven mainly by value. Can Fin Homes states they have been able to reach the same amount of inquiries, although December was a little “soft” Rate competition is not as significant a factor as before. Competitive Positioning # Private banks have reduced rate competition, but competition from NBFCs and PSU banks is not explicitly stated as having settled. Can Fin Homes focuses on speed of loan delivery, ability to serve specific segments, and geographical penetration as key differentiators. Market Challenges/Opportunities # Challenges in Karnataka (e-khata issue) and Telangana (government review of land approvals) are impacting the entire sector. Opportunity to expand product and segment range (LAP, SENP). Market Share/Positioning # Karnataka contributes about 28% (down from 34%) and Telangana about less than 20% (down from 15%) of the business. Risk Factors &amp; Challenges # Concerns/Challenges # Lower disbursements due to e-khata issues in Karnataka and regulatory reviews in Telangana. Slight increase in Gross NPA. Dependence on the release of e-khatas in Karnataka for future growth. Potential disruption from the IT transformation project. Stress in customer´s cash flow. Regulatory Issues # The e-khata issue in Karnataka is a regulatory/operational challenge. Government reviews of land approvals in Telangana are impacting sentiment and business. Discussion about RBI guidelines on parent and subsidiary not doing the same kind of business (Canara Bank being the parent). No clarity at present on implications. Operational Constraints # The e-khata issue is preventing property registrations, impacting disbursements. Implementation of the new IT system could cause temporary disruptions. Check bounce charges, and the fact that advance EMI are not held, impacts SMA numbers. Forward-Looking Statements # Outlook/Projections # Expect disbursements to be in the range of Q4 of last year, potentially better if Karnataka improves. Maintain guidance of 2.5% spread and 3.5% NIM. Expect to close the year with 17%&#43; ROE and 2.1%&#43; ROA. FY26 Target AUM growth of 15% Commitments/Targets # Targeting INR 12,000 crores disbursement for FY ‘26. Aiming for a cost-to-income ratio of 18% - 18,5% in FY ‘26, due to IT investments. Target of 15 new branches in Q4 SENP &#43; professionals will not go over 35% Planned Investments # Significant investment in the IT transformation project (INR 250-300 crores). Sentiment about Future Performance # Cautiously optimistic, with performance heavily reliant on resolving the Karnataka e-khata issue. Confident in maintaining spread and NIM targets. Q&amp;A Insights # Most Pressing Analyst Questions # Impact of the e-khata issue and its expected duration. Reasons for the decline in approvals. Details on the SMA 0 accounts and check bounce charges. Strategy for branch expansion. Impact of the IT transformation project on business and costs. Guidance on credit costs and cost-to-income ratio. Source of NHB refinancing (Affordable Housing Fund vs. regular refinance). Management’s Responses # Provided detailed explanations of the issues in Karnataka and Telangana. Explained the reasons for the increase in SMA 0 (check bounce charges). Detailed the branch expansion and rationalization strategy. Acknowledged potential disruption from the IT project but emphasized efforts to minimize it. Provided clear guidance on credit costs and cost-to-income ratio. New Information Revealed # Detailed breakdown of the SMA 0 portfolio, highlighting the impact of check bounce charges (INR 770 crores). Specific numbers on the progress of e-khata issuance in Karnataka. Breakdown of NHB refinancing (INR 400 crores from AHF, INR 1,200 crores from regular refinance). Quantified impact of issues in Karnataka and Telangana on disbursements (INR 432 crores). Management Tone &amp; Sentiment # Overall Tone # The tone was cautiously optimistic. While acknowledging significant challenges, management expressed confidence in their strategies and long-term targets. There’s a clear sense of addressing problems head-on. Changes in Language # More emphasis on the impact of external factors (e-khata, Telangana regulations) compared to previous calls. Areas of Confidence/Concern # Confident in maintaining spread and NIM, and in the long-term growth prospects. Concerned about the e-khata issue in Karnataka and its impact on disbursements. Confident about IT project but careful about potential disruptions. Most Important Takeaways # External Challenges: Can Fin Homes faced significant headwinds in Q3 FY25 due to regulatory/operational issues in Karnataka and Telangana, leading to flat disbursements and missed growth targets.">
