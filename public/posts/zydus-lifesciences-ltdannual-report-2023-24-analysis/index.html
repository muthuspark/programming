</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Severity:</strong> High. The company faces intense competition, impacting pricing power, particularly in the US formulations market.</li>
<li><strong>Likelihood:</strong> High. The global generics market is highly competitive, with many players, leading to continuous price erosion.</li>
<li><strong>Trend:</strong> Increasing. Competition in the generics space is intensifying, with new players entering existing product markets.</li>
<li><strong>Mitigation Strategies:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Expand the volume of the existing portfolio.</li>
