  <meta property="og:title" content="Aeroflex Industries Limited: Annual Report 2023-24 Analysis">
  <meta property="og:description" content="Summary # This analysis examines Aeroflex Industries Limited’s (AIL) annual report for the fiscal year 2023-24, covering financial performance, business segments, risks, and ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) initiatives.
I. Financial Performance:
AIL’s FY24 performance shows significant growth across key metrics, largely driven by a successful IPO and increased demand:
Total Income: ₹321.75 Crores (19% YoY growth). This substantial increase signifies strong market traction and successful expansion strategies. EBITDA: ₹65.65 Crores (24% YoY growth). Improved profitability suggests efficient operations and cost management. EBITDA margin stood at a healthy 20.40%. PAT: ₹41.73 Crores (38.41% YoY growth). A significant jump in net profit reflects both revenue growth and improved profitability. EPS: ₹3.39 (substantial increase compared to FY23’s ₹2.64). This indicates increased earnings per share for existing shareholders. Dividend: The company declared a 12.5% dividend on equity for FY24, demonstrating a commitment to shareholder returns. Debt: The company boasts a near-zero net debt position (0.0004 Debt-to-Equity ratio) after repaying borrowings, significantly improving its financial health and flexibility. Financial Ratios Analysis (Standalone and Consolidated): The report presents a detailed breakdown of financial ratios, showing significant improvements in some areas, notably current ratio and debt-equity ratio, while others experienced declines (e.g., Return on Equity, Return on Capital Employed), largely attributable to the substantial increase in equity following the IPO. A thorough comparative analysis requires detailed review of the notes to accounts, which are not completely included in this text. Key areas of further investigation include understanding the variance between standalone and consolidated statements, specifically inventory turnover, trade receivables/payables turnover ratios, and net capital turnover.">

  Summary
  <a class="anchor" href="#summary">#</a>
</h2>
<p>This analysis examines Aeroflex Industries Limited&rsquo;s (AIL) annual report for the fiscal year 2023-24, covering financial performance, business segments, risks, and ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) initiatives.</p>
<p><strong>I. Financial Performance:</strong></p>
<p>AIL&rsquo;s FY24 performance shows significant growth across key metrics, largely driven by a successful IPO and increased demand:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Total Income:</strong> ₹321.75 Crores (19% YoY growth).  This substantial increase signifies strong market traction and successful expansion strategies.</li>
<li><strong>EBITDA:</strong> ₹65.65 Crores (24% YoY growth).  Improved profitability suggests efficient operations and cost management. EBITDA margin stood at a healthy 20.40%.</li>
<li><strong>PAT:</strong> ₹41.73 Crores (38.41% YoY growth).  A significant jump in net profit reflects both revenue growth and improved profitability.</li>
<li><strong>EPS:</strong> ₹3.39 (substantial increase compared to FY23&rsquo;s ₹2.64). This indicates increased earnings per share for existing shareholders.</li>
<li><strong>Dividend:</strong> The company declared a 12.5% dividend on equity for FY24, demonstrating a commitment to shareholder returns.</li>
<li><strong>Debt:</strong>  The company boasts a near-zero net debt position (0.0004 Debt-to-Equity ratio) after repaying borrowings, significantly improving its financial health and flexibility.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Financial Ratios Analysis (Standalone and Consolidated):</strong> The report presents a detailed breakdown of financial ratios, showing significant improvements in some areas, notably current ratio and debt-equity ratio, while others experienced declines (e.g., Return on Equity, Return on Capital Employed), largely attributable to the substantial increase in equity following the IPO.  A thorough comparative analysis requires detailed review of the notes to accounts, which are not completely included in this text.  Key areas of further investigation include understanding the variance between standalone and consolidated statements, specifically inventory turnover, trade receivables/payables turnover ratios, and net capital turnover.</p>
<p><strong>II. Business Segments:</strong></p>
<p>AIL&rsquo;s core business is the manufacturing of metallic flexible flow solutions, catering to various industries.  Key segments and their revenue contribution (FY24):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stainless Steel Flexible Hoses (60.4%):</strong> This remains the largest contributor, benefiting from infrastructure development and industrial growth.</li>
<li><strong>Assemblies &amp; Fittings (33.6%):</strong>  A significant segment, demonstrating strong demand for customized, integrated solutions.  The acquisition of Hyd-Air Engineering is expected to boost this segment further.</li>
<li><strong>Composite Hoses, Interlock Hoses &amp; Others (6%):</strong>  A smaller but growing segment targeting new-age industries.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Market Expansion:</strong> AIL is strategically expanding into new-age industries such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fire Fighting:</strong>  High-pressure hoses for sprinkler systems.</li>
<li><strong>Electric Mobility (EV):</strong> Thermal management solutions for EVs.</li>
<li><strong>Robotics:</strong> Hoses for pneumatic and automation applications.</li>
<li><strong>Semiconductors:</strong>  Small-diameter hoses for chip fabrication.</li>
<li><strong>Aerospace &amp; Defence:</strong> Hoses for fuel, lubrication, and cooling systems.</li>
<li><strong>Solar:</strong> Hoses for solar water heating systems.</li>
</ul>
<p>This diversification reduces reliance on traditional industries and positions AIL for growth in high-potential sectors.</p>
<p><strong>III. Risks:</strong></p>
<p>The annual report highlights many key risks:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Supply Chain Risk:</strong> Dependence on global supply chains exposes AIL to geopolitical disruptions, material price volatility, and logistical challenges.  Mitigation strategies include supplier diversification and strategic stockpiling.</li>
<li><strong>Regulatory Risk:</strong>  Compliance with evolving environmental, safety, and other regulations is crucial.  AIL maintains a robust compliance program to address this.</li>
<li><strong>Currency Risk:</strong>  Significant export sales expose AIL to foreign exchange rate fluctuations.  Diversification of export markets helps mitigate this.</li>
<li><strong>Commodity Price Risk:</strong>  Fluctuations in stainless steel prices directly impact AIL&rsquo;s profitability.  Product diversification and flexible sourcing strategies help buffer against this.</li>
<li><strong>Safety Risk:</strong>  Maintaining a safe working environment is crucial. AIL emphasizes regular safety audits and employee training.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>IV. ESG Initiatives:</strong></p>
<p>AIL demonstrates a commitment to ESG through various initiatives:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Environmental:</strong>
<ul>
<li>100% water recycling.</li>
<li>Significant use (35-40%) of recycled packaging materials, with a target of 100% in three years.</li>
<li>Use of electric vehicles within the plant.</li>
<li>Zero-emission production technologies.</li>
<li>ISO 14001:2015 certification.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Social:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Designated Occupational Healthcare Centre and Mind &amp; Body Wellness Centre for employees.</li>
<li>On-site crèche facility.</li>
<li>Regular health check-ups and wellness programs.</li>
<li>Blood donation camps and tree plantation drives.</li>
<li>&lsquo;Great Place to Work&rsquo; certification.</li>
<li>CSR spend of ₹57.50 Lakhs in FY24.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Governance:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Strong Board composition with a mix of executive, non-executive, and independent directors.</li>
<li>Well-defined risk management and corporate governance policies.</li>
<li>Implementation of SAP ERP system for efficient operations.</li>
<li>Transparent communication with stakeholders.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>V. Acquisition:</strong></p>
<p>The acquisition of Hyd-Air Engineering Private Limited represents a strategic move to expand AIL&rsquo;s product portfolio into complete assemblies and fittings, thereby increasing value and reducing lead times.  This acquisition broadens AIL&rsquo;s market reach into new sectors like railways and shipbuilding.</p>
<p><strong>VI. Overall Assessment:</strong></p>
<p>AIL&rsquo;s FY24 annual report demonstrates strong financial performance, strategic diversification, and a commitment to sustainable growth.  The successful IPO provides substantial resources for future expansion plans. However, careful management of supply chain, regulatory, currency, and commodity price risks remains essential.  The company&rsquo;s growing commitment to ESG initiatives enhances its long-term sustainability and stakeholder value.  Further detailed analysis of the financial statements and notes, including the consolidated statements, is recommended to form a complete picture.</p>

  What is the company name, fiscal year, and report date?
  <a class="anchor" href="#what-is-the-company-name-fiscal-year-and-report-date">#</a>
</h2>
<p>The company name is <strong>Aeroflex Industries Limited</strong>.  The fiscal year covered in the report is <strong>2023-24</strong> (April 1, 2023, to March 31, 2024). The report date is <strong>June 3, 2024</strong>.</p>

  <a class="anchor" href="#what-are-the-total-assets-current-assets-cash-and-equivalents-accounts-receivable-and-inventory-values">#</a>
</h2>
<p>The provided text gives the values in Indian Rupees (₹) in Lakhs (1 Lakh = 100,000).  Here&rsquo;s a summary of the requested values from the <strong>Consolidated Balance Sheet as of March 31, 2024</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Total Assets:</strong> ₹37,496.95 Lakhs  (₹3,74,96,95,000)</li>
<li><strong>Total Current Assets:</strong> ₹28,007.77 Lakhs (₹28,00,77,000)</li>
<li><strong>Cash and Cash Equivalents:</strong> ₹7,650.03 Lakhs (₹7,65,00,300)</li>
<li><strong>Accounts Receivable (Trade Receivables):</strong> ₹9,472.28 Lakhs (₹9,47,22,800)</li>
<li><strong>Inventory:</strong> ₹5,894.24 Lakhs (₹5,89,42,400)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Note:</strong>  These figures are from the <em>consolidated</em> balance sheet, which includes the financial statements of Aeroflex Industries Limited and its subsidiaries.  The standalone financial statements (for Aeroflex Industries Limited only) would show different figures.  The exact numbers might slightly vary depending on rounding and the degree of precision in the original report.</p>
<h2 class="heading" id="what-are-the-total-liabilities-current-liabilities-long-term-debt-and-accounts-payable">
  What are the total liabilities, current liabilities, long-term debt, and accounts payable?
  <a class="anchor" href="#what-are-the-total-liabilities-current-liabilities-long-term-debt-and-accounts-payable">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Again, these figures are in Indian Rupees (₹) in Lakhs from the <strong>Consolidated Balance Sheet as of March 31, 2024</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Total Liabilities:</strong> ₹8,181.97 Lakhs (₹8,18,19,700)</li>
<li><strong>Total Current Liabilities:</strong> ₹8,103.68 Lakhs (₹8,10,36,800)</li>
<li><strong>Long-Term Debt (Borrowings - Non-Current):</strong> ₹6.34 Lakhs (₹6,34,000)</li>
<li><strong>Accounts Payable (Trade Payables):</strong>  The report separates accounts payable into those owed to Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) and those owed to other creditors.  Adding those together: ₹5,514.26 Lakhs (₹5,51,42,600)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Note:</strong>  As previously mentioned, these are <em>consolidated</em> figures and will differ from the standalone balance sheet.  Slight variations may occur due to rounding. The classification of current vs. non-current liabilities might also depend on the company&rsquo;s operating cycle and accounting policies,  which are not fully detailed here.</p>
<h2 class="heading" id="what-are-the-shareholders-equity-retained-earnings-and-share-capital-values">
  What are the shareholders&rsquo; equity, retained earnings, and share capital values?
  <a class="anchor" href="#what-are-the-shareholders-equity-retained-earnings-and-share-capital-values">#</a>
</h2>
<p>These values are in Indian Rupees (₹) in Lakhs from the <strong>Consolidated Balance Sheet as of March 31, 2024</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Total Equity:</strong> ₹29,314.98 Lakhs (₹29,31,49,800)</li>
<li><strong>Retained Earnings:</strong>  This is not directly stated as a single line item. It&rsquo;s a component of &ldquo;Other Equity,&rdquo; calculated as the difference between other equity and share premium.  Based on Note 14, we can calculate it as approximately ₹10,647.67 Lakhs (₹10,64,76,700)  .  However,  double-checking this calculation against the original report is advised.</li>
<li><strong>Share Capital (Equity Share Capital):</strong> ₹2,586.41 Lakhs (₹2,58,64,100)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Note:</strong> These figures are from the <em>consolidated</em> balance sheet.  The standalone figures will be different.  There might be minor discrepancies due to rounding or slight differences in how the numbers were presented and then interpreted.  Always cross-reference with the original document for the most precise data.</p>
<h2 class="heading" id="what-are-the-revenue-cost-of-revenue-gross-profit-operating-expenses-and-operating-income">
  What are the revenue, cost of revenue, gross profit, operating expenses, and operating income?
  <a class="anchor" href="#what-are-the-revenue-cost-of-revenue-gross-profit-operating-expenses-and-operating-income">#</a>
</h2>
<p>The following figures are from the <strong>Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss</strong> for the year ended March 31, 2024, in Indian Rupees (₹) in Lakhs:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Revenue (Total Income):</strong> ₹32,175.05 Lakhs (₹32,17,50,500)</li>
<li><strong>Cost of Revenue:</strong> This isn&rsquo;t a single line item.  It&rsquo;s calculated by summing up the cost of materials consumed, changes in inventories, and employee benefit expenses directly related to production. Based on the provided excerpts, this calculation would be ₹20,723.88  - ₹583.59 + ₹2,620.18 = ₹22,750.47 Lakhs.  However, it&rsquo;s essential to note that this is an <em>estimate</em> derived from potentially incomplete data provided. The exact cost of revenue number should be obtained directly from the full annual report&rsquo;s cost of goods sold calculation.</li>
<li><strong>Gross Profit:</strong> This is calculated as Revenue - Cost of Revenue. Using the estimated cost of revenue above: ₹32,175.05 - ₹22,750.47 = ₹9,424.58 Lakhs (This is an <em>estimate</em> and should be verified against the complete report).</li>
<li><strong>Operating Expenses:</strong>  This includes finance costs, depreciation and amortization expense, and other expenses. Summing these from the statement: ₹213.86 + ₹626.19 + ₹2,849.51 = ₹3,689.56 Lakhs.</li>
<li><strong>Operating Income (Profit before exceptional items and tax):</strong> This is calculated as Gross Profit - Operating Expenses.  Using the above estimates: ₹9,424.58 - ₹3,689.56 = ₹5,735.02 Lakhs. (This is an <em>estimate</em> and should be verified.)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Crucial Note:</strong> The calculations for Cost of Revenue and Gross Profit are <em>approximations</em> due to the incomplete data provided.  The annual report would contain precise numbers. The provided text doesn&rsquo;t clearly separate direct manufacturing costs from administrative and other operating expenses, leading to potential inaccuracies in the &lsquo;Cost of Revenue&rsquo; and subsequent calculations.  Refer to the complete annual report for exact figures.</p>
<h2 class="heading" id="what-are-the-net-income-ebitda-basic-eps-and-diluted-eps-values">
  What are the net income, EBITDA, basic EPS, and diluted EPS values?
  <a class="anchor" href="#what-are-the-net-income-ebitda-basic-eps-and-diluted-eps-values">#</a>
</h2>
<p>These figures are from the <strong>Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss</strong> for the year ended March 31, 2024, in Indian Rupees (₹) in Lakhs, unless otherwise specified:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Net Income (Profit for the year):</strong> ₹4,173.40 Lakhs (₹4,17,34,000)</li>
<li><strong>EBITDA (Profit before tax, depreciation, exceptional items, and interest):</strong> ₹6,565.08 Lakhs (₹6,56,50,800)</li>
<li><strong>Basic EPS:</strong> ₹3.39</li>
<li><strong>Diluted EPS:</strong> ₹3.39</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Note:</strong> These are <em>consolidated</em> values. The standalone statement will provide different numbers.  Always refer to the original annual report for confirmation.  There&rsquo;s a possibility of minor discrepancies due to rounding differences in this transcription.</p>
<h2 class="heading" id="what-are-the-operating-investing-and-financing-cash-flows">
  What are the operating, investing, and financing cash flows?
  <a class="anchor" href="#what-are-the-operating-investing-and-financing-cash-flows">#</a>
</h2>
<p>The following figures are from the <strong>Consolidated Cash Flow Statement</strong> for the year ended March 31, 2024, in Indian Rupees (₹) in Lakhs:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cash Flow from Operating Activities:</strong> ₹4,407.87 Lakhs (₹4,40,78,700)</li>
<li><strong>Cash Flow from Investing Activities:</strong> ₹(3,490.46) Lakhs (₹-3,49,04,600)  The negative sign indicates a net cash <em>outflow</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Cash Flow from Financing Activities:</strong> ₹9,029.60 Lakhs (₹9,02,96,000)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Note:</strong> These are <em>consolidated</em> cash flow figures. The standalone statement will likely show different amounts. Minor discrepancies might exist due to rounding or differences in presentation in this transcription compared to the original.  Always consult the original annual report for precise data.</p>
<h2 class="heading" id="what-are-the-free-cash-flow-capital-expenditure-and-dividends-paid">
  What are the free cash flow, capital expenditure, and dividends paid?
  <a class="anchor" href="#what-are-the-free-cash-flow-capital-expenditure-and-dividends-paid">#</a>
</h2>
<p>The provided text does not directly state free cash flow (FCF). FCF is calculated as operating cash flow less capital expenditures.  We have the operating cash flow from the consolidated cash flow statement: ₹4,407.87 Lakhs.  However, we need the capital expenditure figure to calculate FCF.  The report mentions capital expenditures (capex) within the discussion of expansion plans, but doesn&rsquo;t provide a single, summarized capex number for the entire fiscal year.  Therefore, a precise FCF calculation cannot be made from the provided information.</p>
<p>To calculate the capital expenditure, you would need to sum up all the individual capital investments mentioned in the report&rsquo;s discussion of expansion timelines and capex plans, but this information is not presented in a consolidated table.  A precise calculation requires accessing the complete annual report.</p>
<p>Regarding dividends, the <strong>Consolidated Cash Flow Statement</strong> shows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dividends Paid:</strong> ₹(228.64) Lakhs (₹-2,28,64,000). The negative sign denotes a cash outflow.</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember that these figures are from the <em>consolidated</em> statements. The standalone numbers will differ.  For accurate FCF and other details, refer to the full annual report.</p>
<h2 class="heading" id="what-are-the-profitability-ratios-gross-margin-operating-margin-net-profit-margin-roe-roa">
  What are the profitability ratios (gross margin, operating margin, net profit margin, ROE, ROA)?
  <a class="anchor" href="#what-are-the-profitability-ratios-gross-margin-operating-margin-net-profit-margin-roe-roa">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Calculating precise profitability ratios requires the exact figures from the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss, which are not fully available from the provided text.  Some values are estimates due to incomplete data, as previously explained.  Therefore, these calculations will be <em>approximations</em> based on the estimates from earlier responses.  You should consult the original annual report for accurate calculations.</p>
<p>Using the estimated values from previous responses:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Revenue:</strong> ₹32,175.05 Lakhs</li>
<li><strong>Estimated Cost of Revenue:</strong> ₹22,750.47 Lakhs</li>
<li><strong>Estimated Gross Profit:</strong> ₹9,424.58 Lakhs</li>
<li><strong>Estimated Operating Income:</strong> ₹5,735.02 Lakhs</li>
<li><strong>Net Income:</strong> ₹4,173.40 Lakhs</li>
<li><strong>Total Assets (Consolidated):</strong> ₹37,496.95 Lakhs</li>
<li><strong>Shareholders&rsquo; Equity (Consolidated):</strong> ₹29,314.98 Lakhs</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on these figures (remembering the estimations):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Gross Profit Margin:</strong> (Estimated Gross Profit / Revenue) * 100 = (₹9,424.58 Lakhs / ₹32,175.05 Lakhs) * 100 ≈ 29.3%</li>
<li><strong>Operating Profit Margin:</strong> (Estimated Operating Income / Revenue) * 100 = (₹5,735.02 Lakhs / ₹32,175.05 Lakhs) * 100 ≈ 17.8%</li>
<li><strong>Net Profit Margin:</strong> (Net Income / Revenue) * 100 = (₹4,173.40 Lakhs / ₹32,175.05 Lakhs) * 100 ≈ 13.0%</li>
<li><strong>Return on Equity (ROE):</strong> (Net Income / Shareholders&rsquo; Equity) * 100 = (₹4,173.40 Lakhs / ₹29,314.98 Lakhs) * 100 ≈ 14.2%</li>
<li><strong>Return on Assets (ROA):</strong> (Net Income / Total Assets) * 100 = (₹4,173.40 Lakhs / ₹37,496.95 Lakhs) * 100 ≈ 11.1%</li>
</ul>
<p>These  are  approximations. The actual values will be found in the complete annual report.  The report itself should also include more precise calculations of these ratios.</p>
<h2 class="heading" id="what-are-the-liquidity-ratios-current-ratio-quick-ratio-cash-ratio">
  What are the liquidity ratios (current ratio, quick ratio, cash ratio)?
  <a class="anchor" href="#what-are-the-liquidity-ratios-current-ratio-quick-ratio-cash-ratio">#</a>
</h2>
<p>To calculate liquidity ratios, we need the following figures from the <strong>Consolidated Balance Sheet as of March 31, 2024</strong>, in Indian Rupees (₹) in Lakhs:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Current Assets:</strong> ₹28,007.77 Lakhs</li>
<li><strong>Current Liabilities:</strong> ₹8,103.68 Lakhs</li>
<li><strong>Inventory:</strong> ₹5,894.24 Lakhs</li>
<li><strong>Cash and Cash Equivalents:</strong> ₹7,650.03 Lakhs</li>
</ul>
<p>Using these figures:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Current Ratio:</strong> Current Assets / Current Liabilities = ₹28,007.77 Lakhs / ₹8,103.68 Lakhs ≈ 3.46</li>
<li><strong>Quick Ratio:</strong> (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities = (₹28,007.77 Lakhs - ₹5,894.24 Lakhs) / ₹8,103.68 Lakhs ≈ 2.72</li>
<li><strong>Cash Ratio:</strong> Cash and Cash Equivalents / Current Liabilities = ₹7,650.03 Lakhs / ₹8,103.68 Lakhs ≈ 0.94</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Note:</strong> These ratios are based on the <em>consolidated</em> balance sheet.  Standalone figures would produce different results.  Minor variations are possible due to rounding differences between the original report and this analysis. For the most accurate figures, always refer to the original annual report.

<p>Calculating precise efficiency ratios requires more information than what&rsquo;s readily available in the provided text excerpts.  Specifically, we need the precise figures for net sales (or revenue) and average inventory and receivables.  The excerpts provide year-end values, but the average values needed for these ratio calculations are not provided. The full annual report is necessary for these calculations.  The provided ratio analysis in Note 48 gives some turnover ratios, but it is missing the needed components to verify the calculation.   Therefore, I cannot provide the exact values. To calculate these ratios accurately, you need to consult the complete annual report.</p>

</h2>
<p>The provided text gives us some of the necessary data from the <strong>Consolidated Balance Sheet</strong> to calculate use ratios, but not all.  We will use the consolidated figures.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Total Debt:</strong> This is not explicitly stated as a single figure.  It needs to be calculated by summing current and non-current borrowings.  Based on notes 15 and 17:  ₹6.34 Lakhs (Non-Current) + ₹5.77 Lakhs (Current) = ₹12.11 Lakhs (This is an approximation and might vary slightly depending on how other liabilities are classified as debt)</li>
<li><strong>Total Shareholders&rsquo; Equity:</strong> ₹29,314.98 Lakhs</li>
<li><strong>Total Assets:</strong> ₹37,496.95 Lakhs</li>
<li><strong>EBITDA:</strong> ₹6,565.08 Lakhs</li>
<li><strong>Interest Expense:</strong> ₹213.86 Lakhs</li>
</ul>
<p>Using these values (and noting the approximation of total debt):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Debt-to-Equity Ratio:</strong> Total Debt / Total Shareholders&rsquo; Equity = ₹12.11 Lakhs / ₹29,314.98 Lakhs ≈ 0.0004</li>
<li><strong>Debt-to-Assets Ratio:</strong> Total Debt / Total Assets = ₹12.11 Lakhs / ₹37,496.95 Lakhs ≈ 0.0003</li>
<li><strong>Interest Coverage Ratio:</strong> EBITDA / Interest Expense = ₹6,565.08 Lakhs / ₹213.86 Lakhs ≈ 30.6</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Notes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>These use ratios are based on the <em>consolidated</em> balance sheet.  The standalone report would yield different numbers.</li>
<li>The calculation of total debt is an <em>approximation</em> because the provided text does not explicitly define all items included within the total debt calculation.</li>
<li>The  interest  coverage  ratio  uses  EBITDA,  which  is  a  non-GAAP  measure.</li>

  What is the auditor&rsquo;s opinion and what are the key accounting policies?
  <a class="anchor" href="#what-is-the-auditors-opinion-and-what-are-the-key-accounting-policies">#</a>
</h2>
<p>The auditor&rsquo;s opinion on both the <strong>Consolidated Financial Statements</strong> and the <strong>Standalone Financial Statements</strong> is <strong>unmodified</strong>. This means the auditors found the financial statements to present a true and fair view in accordance with Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) and other generally accepted accounting principles in India.  The auditors did note some key audit matters related to the valuation of Property, Plant, and Equipment, but these did not lead to a modification of their opinion.</p>
<p>The key accounting policies, as summarized from the notes to the financial statements, include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Basis of Preparation and Presentation:</strong> The financial statements are prepared in accordance with Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) using the historical cost convention, except for certain financial instruments measured at fair value.</li>
<li><strong>Basis of Consolidation:</strong> Consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the parent company and its subsidiaries, using line-by-line consolidation with elimination of intragroup transactions.</li>
<li><strong>Significant Accounting Estimates:</strong> The report acknowledges many areas requiring significant judgment and estimation, including impairment testing, useful lives of assets, provisions for contingencies, deferred tax, valuation of inventories, and the fair valuation of financial instruments.</li>
<li><strong>Current/Non-Current Classification:</strong> Assets and liabilities are classified as current or non-current based on their expected realization or settlement within the operating cycle (defined as 12 months).</li>
<li><strong>Property, Plant, and Equipment:</strong>  Measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment, using the written-down value method.  Useful lives are estimated and reviewed periodically.</li>
<li><strong>Intangible Assets:</strong> Recognized when future economic benefits are probable and the cost is reliably measurable. Amortized over their useful lives using the written-down value method.  Impairment testing is performed annually.</li>
<li><strong>Foreign Currency Transactions:</strong>  Transactions are recorded at the exchange rate at the transaction date.  Monetary items are restated at year-end rates, with exchange differences recognized in profit or loss.</li>
<li><strong>Revenue Recognition:</strong>  Follows the five-step model of Ind AS 115 for revenue from contracts with customers.  Revenue from sales of goods is recognized upon transfer of control to the customer.</li>
<li><strong>Inventories:</strong> Valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value, using the weighted average cost method for raw materials and finished goods.</li>
<li><strong>Cash and Cash Equivalents:</strong> Includes cash on hand, bank balances, and short-term highly liquid investments.</li>
<li><strong>Taxation:</strong>  Includes current and deferred tax expenses, recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss (except for items recognized in other detailed income or directly in equity).</li>
<li><strong>Borrowing Costs:</strong> Costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction, or production of qualifying assets are capitalized. Other borrowing costs are expensed.</li>
<li><strong>Provisions:</strong> Recognized when a present obligation is probable and the amount can be reliably estimated.</li>
<li><strong>Financial Instruments:</strong>  Classified and measured according to Ind AS 109, using amortized cost, fair value through other detailed income (FVOCI), or fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL), depending on the business model and contractual terms.  Impairment is assessed using the expected credit loss model.</li>
</ul>
