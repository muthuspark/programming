  Strategic Risks
  <a class="anchor" href="#strategic-risks">#</a>
</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Severity:</strong> High. The pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive, with both domestic and international players, putting pressure on pricing and market share.</li>
<li><strong>Likelihood:</strong> High. The Indian pharmaceutical market is growing, but competition is intensifying.</li>
<li><strong>Trend:</strong> Increasing. The number of INR 100 Cr. brand families increased, but growth rates in some key therapies are slowing.</li>
<li><strong>Mitigation Strategies:</strong> Diversifying product portfolio, expanding into chronic therapies, pursuing inorganic growth (M&amp;A, in-licensing), focusing on metro and tier-1 cities, and launching DMF grade API products.</li>
<li><strong>Control Effectiveness:</strong> Partially effective. The chronic segment share increased to 36% in FY24, demonstrating success in diversification. Market share in key therapeutic segments presents a mix bag, with increases in some and decreases in others.</li>
<li><strong>Potential Financial Impact:</strong> Revenue growth is dependent on successful execution of strategic initiatives; Failure to gain significant market share could lead to flat or declining revenue.</li>

  Operational Risks

</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Severity:</strong> Medium. Disruptions in the supply chain can significantly impact production and profitability. Reliance on in-house manufacturing (75%) increases control but also concentrates operational risk.</li>

<li><strong>Trend:</strong> Stable. Supply chain resilience strategies were effective in mitigating the impact of the Sikkim plant shutdown.</li>
<li><strong>Mitigation Strategies:</strong> Diversifying sourcing, implementing advanced technologies like AI/ML for supply chain planning (Project Adapt), warehouse and distribution transformation (Project Wave), and adopting Lean and Six Sigma methodologies.</li>
<li><strong>Control Effectiveness:</strong> Effective. The Sikkim plant shutdown had minimal impact, and the Net Operating working capital days were optimized to 42 days.</li>
<li><strong>Potential Financial Impact:</strong> Capex investments in new facilities and technology upgrades (INR 389 crore in FY24) represent ongoing operational investment.</li>
