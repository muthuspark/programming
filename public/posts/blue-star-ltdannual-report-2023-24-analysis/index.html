  Analysis of Accounting Quality and Regulatory Risk Assessment
  <a class="anchor" href="#analysis-of-accounting-quality-and-regulatory-risk-assessment">#</a>
</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Accounting Quality:</strong> The adoption of Ind AS, along with the unmodified audit opinion and emphasis on using estimates and judgments prudently, suggests a high quality of financial reporting. The change in depreciation method impacts comparability. The consistent application of accounting policies provides transparency. The detailed note disclosures, including segment reporting and related party transactions, also enhance accounting quality.</li>
<li><strong>Regulatory Risk Assessment:</strong> There is adherence to significant regulations, including those related to corporate governance, Listing. Disclosure of pending litigations indicates a proactive approach to managing legal risks. However, the existence of disputes with tax authorities may pose regulatory risk. Overall, the regulatory risk appears moderate, given the proactive compliance and disclosure, but hinges on the resolution of pending legal and tax disputes.</li>
