</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Scenario 1: Delayed Decision-Making and Cash Conservation:</strong> If delayed decision-making and cash conservation continue into FY 2025, it could lead to a moderation in growth.</li>
<li><strong>Sensitivity:</strong> The analysis assumes that customer demand for cost optimization and cloud transformation remains strong. A significant shift in customer priorities away from these areas could negatively impact TCS&rsquo;s growth.</li>
<li><strong>Sensitivity to Margin Targets</strong>: While TCS reported Q4 2024 margin of 26%, demonstrating their commitment to the 26-28%, a deviation from cost saving targets could negatively affect the ability to attain margins.</li>
<li><strong>Sensitivity:</strong> The sensitivity analysis of the revenue to currency movement has been disclosed to be 3.4%.</li>
<li><strong>Sensitivity:</strong> A 10% appreciation/depreciation of the respective functional currency against various foreign currencies would result in an increase/decrease of approximately ₹338 crore, in the company&rsquo;s profit before tax, for the year ended 31 March 2024.</li>
<li><strong>Sensitivity:</strong> TCS is exposed to financial risk arising from changes in foreign exchange rates, interest rates, credit, and liquidity.</li>
