<ul>
<li><strong>Severity:</strong> High. The automotive industry is undergoing rapid transformation (E.P.I.C. - Electric, Personalized, Intelligent, and Connected).</li>
<li><strong>Likelihood:</strong> High. BEV revenue share increased from 26% (FY23) to 29% (FY24), and 79% of the INR 226 billion order book is from EV programs.</li>
<li><strong>Trend:</strong> Increasing.</li>
<li><strong>Mitigation Strategies:</strong> Diversifying revenue mix across geographies, products, and market segments. Increased R&amp;D spending(~INR 1,966 million since listing).</li>
<li><strong>Control Effectiveness:</strong> Partially effective. BEV revenue grew by 32% in FY24, but reliance on ICE-dependent products is down to 10%.</li>
<li><strong>Potential Financial Impact:</strong> Significant. Revenue, EBITDA, and PAT have all grown substantially since the IPO (2.0x, 2.0x, and 2.4x, respectively, from FY21), driven largely by new products and EV programs. Failure to adapt could impact future growth.</li>

  Accounting Quality and Regulatory Risk Assessment

<ul>
<li><strong>Accounting Quality:</strong> The use of an external expert for the valuation of Novelic d.o.o. Beograd, suggests that the Company may not have the needed expertise and it may show an area of concern. The adoption of Ind AS, combined with the clean audit opinion, and the absence of modifications suggests a high quality of financial reporting. The use of the Black-Scholes model for ESOP valuation and engagement of independent actuaries for defined benefit obligations indicate robust accounting practices.</li>
<li><strong>Regulatory Risk Assessment:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The Company demonstrates compliance with key regulations, including the Companies Act, 2013, Listing Regulations.</li>
<li>Low Risk: The Company has a Whistle Blower Policy in place, with one complaint, and the matter has been investigated and disciplinary action has been taken</li>
