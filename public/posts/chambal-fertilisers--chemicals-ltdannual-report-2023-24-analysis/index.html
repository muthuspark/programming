</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Severity:</strong> High. Policy changes can significantly impact profitability, especially concerning urea subsidy.</li>
<li><strong>Likelihood:</strong> Medium. Government policies in the fertilizer industry are subject to change.</li>
<li><strong>Trend:</strong> Stable, but with potential for volatility. New Investment Policy 2012 is effective for 8 years from the commencement of production.</li>
<li><strong>Mitigation Strategies:</strong> The Company is trying to continuously engaging with policymakers and diversifying its product portfolio (Technical Ammonium Nitrate project, Crop Protection, and Speciality Nutrients).</li>
<li><strong>Control Effectiveness:</strong> Partially effective. Diversification mitigates some risk, but policy dependence remains high.</li>
<li><strong>Potential Financial Impact:</strong> Substantial, given that 70.81% of standalone revenue in FY2023-24 was from own manufactured fertilizers (primarily urea). Any unfavorable change in policy may put pressure on the revenues and profitability.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Severity:</strong> Medium to High. Plant operations and supply chain disruptions can impact production volume.</li>

<li><strong>Trend:</strong> Improving. Urea production increased from 33.47 lakh MT (FY2022-23) to 33.83 lakh MT (FY2023-24).</li>
<li><strong>Mitigation Strategies:</strong> Implemented robust Health, Safety, Security, Environment &amp; Quality Policy. Process safety management system, Behavior Based Safety program. Regular maintenance, safety audits, and drills.</li>
<li><strong>Control Effectiveness:</strong> High, as evidenced by the National Energy Conservation Award 2023, certificate of merit, and reduced accident rate.</li>

  Financial Risks

</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Severity:</strong> High. Exposure to fluctuations in natural gas prices, imported fertilizer prices, and currency exchange rates (USD).</li>
<li><strong>Likelihood:</strong> Medium to High. Natural gas prices and imported fertilizer prices are volatile. USD/INR exchange rate is also variable.</li>
<li><strong>Trend:</strong> Volatile. Natural gas prices showed less volatility in FY2023-24 compared to FY2022-23.</li>
<li><strong>Mitigation Strategies:</strong> For natural gas, a portion is purchased at fixed prices. For imported fertilizers, dynamic sourcing, pricing strategies, and hedging through forward contracts and option structures are used.</li>
<li><strong>Control Effectiveness:</strong> Partially effective. Hedging and fixed-price contracts provide some protection, but external market forces remain a factor.</li>
<li><strong>Potential Financial Impact:</strong> Significant impact on costs, profit margins, and the valuation of financial instruments. The Interest Coverage Ratio improved from 5.54 (FY2022-23) to 12.22 (FY2023-24), Debt Equity Ratio improved from 0.47 to 0.25.</li>
