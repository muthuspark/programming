  Analysis of Accounting Quality and Regulatory Risk Assessment
  <a class="anchor" href="#analysis-of-accounting-quality-and-regulatory-risk-assessment">#</a>
</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Accounting Quality:</strong> The unmodified audit opinion suggests a high level of accounting quality. However, the observations regarding property title deeds and the delays in compliance filings, if pervasive or persistent, could raise concerns about the robustness of processes.</li>
<li><strong>Regulatory Risk:</strong> While generally compliant, the FEMA-related delay and the various tax disputes indicate moderate regulatory risk. The pending litigations and unfulfilled conditions related to government grants also contribute to this risk. The company&rsquo;s proactive stance in addressing these issues (e.g., filing appeals, making payments under protest) demonstrates a mitigating approach. Consistent observations by the auditor under clause 2B(f) in respect of non- compliances related to audit-trail may lead to regulatory actions by the authorities.</li>
