  <meta property="og:description" content="Overview # Detailed Analysis # This analysis examines Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders Limited’s (MDL) Annual Report for 2023-24, focusing on financial performance, business segments, risk factors, and ESG initiatives.
I. Financial Performance:
MDL reported a stellar financial year, exceeding expectations across key metrics. Significant improvements were driven by a combination of increased revenue, efficient cost management, and favorable one-time gains (liquidated damages write-back).
Revenue from Operations: A record high of ₹9,466.58 crore (US$1,160 million approx.), a 21% increase from ₹7,827.18 crore (US$960 million approx.) in FY2022-23. This impressive growth reflects strong order book execution and successful project deliveries. Profit Before Tax (PBT): ₹2,461.38 crore (US$300 million approx.), a substantial rise of 72% compared to FY2022-23. Excluding exceptional items (primarily liquidated damages write-back), the growth is still robust, highlighting improved operational efficiency. Profit After Tax (PAT): ₹1,845.43 crore (US$225 million approx.), a significant 72% increase year-on-year. This is a remarkable achievement, marking the first time PAT exceeded ₹1,800 crore. EBITDA Margin: Improved significantly to 26.9% in FY2024 from 19.3% in FY2023. The significant improvement is partly attributed to the exceptional items. The management, however, indicates that ahead of schedule deliveries also significantly impact the margin positively. For FY2025, the company projects an EBITDA margin in the vicinity of 27-28%. EPS: Normalized EPS increased to ₹91.5 from ₹53.19, a substantial 72% jump. Dividend: A total dividend of ₹553.64 crore (US$67 million approx.) was declared, including an interim dividend of ₹309.39 crore (US$37 million approx.) and a proposed final dividend of ₹244.25 crore (US$30 million approx.). This represents a significant return to shareholders. Order Book: A robust order book of ₹38,561 crore (US$4700 million approx.) as of March 31, 2024, provides a strong foundation for future revenue streams. The company anticipates significant order book growth in FY2025, potentially reaching ₹40,000-50,000 crore (US$4800-6000 million approx.), largely driven by potential large orders for submarines and next-generation destroyers.

<p>This analysis examines Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders Limited&rsquo;s (MDL) Annual Report for 2023-24, focusing on financial performance, business segments, risk factors, and ESG initiatives.</p>
<p><strong>I. Financial Performance:</strong></p>
<p>MDL reported a stellar financial year, exceeding expectations across key metrics.  Significant improvements were driven by a combination of increased revenue, efficient cost management, and favorable one-time gains (liquidated damages write-back).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Revenue from Operations:</strong>  A record high of ₹9,466.58 crore (US$1,160 million approx.), a 21% increase from ₹7,827.18 crore (US$960 million approx.) in FY2022-23. This impressive growth reflects strong order book execution and successful project deliveries.</li>
<li><strong>Profit Before Tax (PBT):</strong> ₹2,461.38 crore (US$300 million approx.), a substantial rise of 72% compared to FY2022-23.  Excluding exceptional items (primarily liquidated damages write-back), the growth is still robust, highlighting improved operational efficiency.</li>
<li><strong>Profit After Tax (PAT):</strong> ₹1,845.43 crore (US$225 million approx.), a significant 72% increase year-on-year.  This is a remarkable achievement, marking the first time PAT exceeded ₹1,800 crore.</li>
<li><strong>EBITDA Margin:</strong>  Improved significantly to 26.9% in FY2024 from 19.3% in FY2023.  The significant improvement is partly attributed to the exceptional items. The management, however, indicates that ahead of schedule deliveries also significantly impact the margin positively.  For FY2025, the company projects an EBITDA margin in the vicinity of 27-28%.</li>
<li><strong>EPS:</strong> Normalized EPS increased to ₹91.5 from ₹53.19, a substantial 72% jump.</li>
<li><strong>Dividend:</strong> A total dividend of ₹553.64 crore (US$67 million approx.) was declared, including an interim dividend of ₹309.39 crore (US$37 million approx.) and a proposed final dividend of ₹244.25 crore (US$30 million approx.). This represents a significant return to shareholders.</li>
<li><strong>Order Book:</strong> A robust order book of ₹38,561 crore (US$4700 million approx.) as of March 31, 2024, provides a strong foundation for future revenue streams.  The company anticipates significant order book growth in FY2025, potentially reaching ₹40,000-50,000 crore (US$4800-6000 million approx.), largely driven by potential large orders for submarines and next-generation destroyers.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>II. Business Segments:</strong></p>
<p>MDL primarily operates in two segments:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shipbuilding:</strong> This includes new construction of warships (destroyers, frigates, corvettes, missile boats) and offshore patrol vessels for the Indian Navy and Coast Guard, as well as commercial vessels for export markets.  The company is the lead shipyard for major surface combatants (destroyers and frigates) and the only shipyard with two independent submarine assembly and launch lines.</li>
<li><strong>Submarine and Heavy Engineering:</strong> This segment focuses on the construction, repair, and refit of conventional submarines for the Indian Navy. MDL is the sole Indian shipyard capable of producing both destroyers and conventional submarines.</li>
</ul>
<p>The report highlights successful deliveries and launches in both segments, contributing significantly to the overall financial success.</p>
<p><strong>III. Risks:</strong></p>
<p>The annual report acknowledges many key risks:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Geopolitical and economic uncertainties:</strong> Global instability and economic downturns can impact demand, especially for export orders.</li>
<li><strong>Supply chain disruptions:</strong> Dependence on foreign OEMs for critical components poses risks related to delivery delays, price volatility, and geopolitical sanctions.</li>
<li><strong>Competition:</strong> Increasing competition from domestic private shipyards and international players, especially from China and South Korea, necessitates price competitiveness.</li>
<li><strong>Project delays and cost overruns:</strong> The complex nature of shipbuilding and submarine construction makes projects vulnerable to delays, potentially leading to liquidated damages.</li>
<li><strong>Liquidity risk:</strong> While MDL currently boasts substantial cash reserves, maintaining sufficient liquidity amidst large-scale project execution remains a concern.</li>
<li><strong>Regulatory compliance:</strong> Stringent government regulations, especially in the defense sector, necessitate meticulous compliance.</li>
</ul>
<p>MDL&rsquo;s risk management committee actively monitors and mitigates these risks.</p>
<p><strong>IV. ESG Initiatives:</strong></p>
<p>MDL demonstrates a strong commitment to ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) principles.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Environmental Sustainability:</strong>  MDL has installed a 1.85 MWp rooftop solar power plant, promoting renewable energy and reducing its carbon footprint.  Water management initiatives, including sewage and greywater treatment plants, are in place.  A Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) system in the Submarine Section Assembly workshop minimizes water usage and prevents pollution.  Waste management practices focus on recycling, reuse, and responsible disposal, aiming for zero garbage status.  The company has also introduced emission-free electric golf carts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Social Responsibility:</strong>  MDL&rsquo;s CSR initiatives, funded by over ₹22.30 crore (US$2.7 million approx.), are focused on education, healthcare, and skill development, primarily benefiting underprivileged communities.  Specific programs include support for underprivileged students, healthcare initiatives in rural areas, and skill development centers.  The company actively promotes women&rsquo;s empowerment through training and leadership development programs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Governance:</strong> MDL adheres to stringent corporate governance principles, aligning with SEBI (Securities and Exchange Board of India) regulations and DPE (Department of Public Enterprises) guidelines.  The company has established various committees (Audit, Nomination &amp; Remuneration, Stakeholders Relationship, Risk Management, CSR) to oversee operations and ensure ethical practices.  A robust vigilance mechanism is in place to prevent and detect fraud and irregularities.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>V. Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>MDL&rsquo;s Annual Report 2023-24 paints a picture of a financially strong and strategically positioned company.  The record financial performance is impressive, underpinned by a healthy order book and successful project execution.  While the company acknowledges significant risks, its proactive approach to risk management and its commitment to ESG principles demonstrate a sound foundation for sustained growth.  However,  continued  focus  on  mitigating  supply chain vulnerabilities, maintaining price competitiveness, and navigating the complexities of the defence industry will be essential for long-term success. The company’s commitment to ESG is noteworthy, but quantifiable metrics and targets for future performance would improve the report&rsquo;s transparency and impact.</p>

<p>Based on the provided Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders Limited Annual Report for 2023-24, here are the values of the requested financial metrics in Indian Rupees (₹ lakhs):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Total Assets:</strong> ₹2,877,602 lakhs (approximately ₹287.76 billion or US$35 billion approx.)</li>
<li><strong>Total Current Assets:</strong> ₹2,578,819 lakhs (approximately ₹257.88 billion or US$31 billion approx.)</li>
<li><strong>Cash and Cash Equivalents:</strong> ₹352,348 lakhs (approximately ₹35.23 billion or US$4.3 billion approx.)  This includes cash in current and cash credit accounts, flexi deposit accounts and earmarked balances.</li>
<li><strong>Accounts Receivable (Total):</strong> ₹2,30,954 lakhs (approximately ₹23.10 billion or US$2.8 billion approx.). This is the sum of current and non-current receivables.  Note that a significant portion is due from the Indian Navy, and the report explicitly states that reconciliation and confirmation are ongoing for these amounts.</li>
<li><strong>Inventory:</strong> ₹5,71,337 lakhs (approximately ₹57.13 billion or US$7 billion approx.). This encompasses raw materials, stores and spares, equipment for specific projects, stock in transit, and scrap.  The report also notes that significant inventory is held with other vendors and at customer stores, totaling ₹4,403 lakhs (approximately ₹440 million).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Note:</strong> These figures are subject to the limitations and qualifications stated in the independent auditor&rsquo;s report.  The report highlights that certain balances (sundry creditors, accounts receivable, etc.) are subject to further confirmation and reconciliation. Therefore, these values should be considered preliminary until final audited figures are released.  Also note that the exchange rates fluctuate, so the USD conversions are approximations.</p>

  Liability Analysis
  <a class="anchor" href="#liability-analysis">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Based on Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders Limited&rsquo;s (MDL) Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2024, here are the values (in ₹ lakhs) for the requested financial metrics:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Total Liabilities:</strong> ₹2,320,534 lakhs (approximately ₹232.05 billion or US$28 billion approx.)</li>
<li><strong>Total Current Liabilities:</strong> ₹2,263,435 lakhs (approximately ₹226.34 billion or US$27 billion approx.)</li>
<li><strong>Long-Term Debt:</strong>  MDL&rsquo;s Annual Report does <em>not</em> explicitly state a &ldquo;long-term debt&rdquo; figure in a single line item.  However, analyzing the Consolidated Balance Sheet reveals that long-term liabilities include:
<ul>
<li><strong>Lease Liability (Long-term):</strong> ₹81 lakhs (approximately ₹8.1 million)</li>
<li><strong>Long-term provisions:</strong> ₹42,521 lakhs (approximately ₹4.25 billion)</li>
<li><strong>Other non-current liabilities:</strong> ₹12,663 lakhs (approximately ₹1.27 billion)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The total of these three items is ₹55,265 lakhs (approximately ₹5.53 billion), which represents the closest approximation to a &ldquo;long-term debt&rdquo; figure based on the provided information.  The absence of a specific &ldquo;long-term debt&rdquo; line item is common in government-owned entities like MDL.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Accounts Payable (Total):</strong> ₹4,46,279 lakhs (approximately ₹44.63 billion or US$5.4 billion approx.). This comprises both current and non-current accounts payable.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Considerations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Consolidated vs. Standalone:</strong> The figures provided above are from the <em>Consolidated</em> Balance Sheet.  The standalone figures will differ as they do not include the financial information of associated companies.</li>
<li><strong>Auditor&rsquo;s Report:</strong>  The independent auditor&rsquo;s report explicitly states that certain balances, including those related to creditors, are subject to confirmation and reconciliation. Therefore, these values are preliminary and may be subject to revision upon finalization of these processes.</li>
<li><strong>Currency Conversion:</strong> The USD equivalents are approximate conversions based on prevailing exchange rates and may vary.</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, while the provided figures give a reasonable overview, it&rsquo;s essential to remember these caveats when interpreting the data.  The final audited financial statements would offer the most accurate and up-to-date information.</p>

<p>The following cash flow figures are from Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders Limited&rsquo;s (MDL) <strong>Consolidated</strong> Statement of Cash Flows for the year ended March 31, 2024, in ₹ lakhs:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Cash Flow from Operating Activities:</strong> ₹68,375 lakhs (approximately ₹6.84 billion or US$830 million approx.)  This represents net cash <em>from</em> operating activities after accounting for tax payments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cash Flow from Investing Activities:</strong> ₹1,41,981 lakhs (approximately ₹14.20 billion or US$1.7 billion approx.) This is net cash <em>from</em> investing activities.  The significant positive cash flow is largely due to interest and dividend receipts and proceeds from fixed deposits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cash Flow from Financing Activities:</strong> ₹(44,850) lakhs (approximately ₹(4.48) billion or US$(540) million approx.) This represents net cash <em>used in</em> financing activities, primarily due to dividend payments.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Notes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Consolidated Figures:</strong> These numbers reflect the combined cash flows of MDL and its associate company.  Standalone figures would be different.</li>
<li><strong>Rounding:</strong> Figures are rounded to the nearest lakh, as presented in the report.</li>
<li><strong>Currency Conversion:</strong> The USD equivalents are approximate and subject to fluctuations in the exchange rate.</li>
<li><strong>Auditor&rsquo;s Report:</strong> The auditor&rsquo;s report includes qualifications.  This suggests that the reported cash flow figures are preliminary and may be adjusted following the completion of further confirmation and reconciliation procedures.</li>

  Cash Flow Metrics
  <a class="anchor" href="#cash-flow-metrics">#</a>
</h3>
<p>The Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders Limited (MDL) annual report doesn&rsquo;t directly provide a single-line item for &ldquo;free cash flow.&rdquo;  Free cash flow (FCF) needs to be calculated.  However, we can determine the other two requested values.  All figures below are in ₹ lakhs, from the <strong>Consolidated</strong> Statement of Cash Flows.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Capital Expenditure (CAPEX):</strong>  The report doesn&rsquo;t present a single, explicitly labeled CAPEX figure.  Instead, CAPEX needs to be derived from the investing activities section.  Based on the information available, the net change in Property, Plant, and Equipment (after accounting for disposals and adjustments), as well as Capital Work in Progress, would provide the closest estimate for CAPEX. This calculation would require more detailed information from the notes to the financial statements than is currently available.  In the Consolidated Cashflow Statement,  the net cash used for the purchase of property, plant and equipment was ₹10,303 lakhs.  Additionally, net cash used in capital work in progress was ₹1001 lakhs.  Therefore, a <em>rough estimate</em> of CAPEX would be ₹11,304 lakhs (₹10,303 + ₹1001). However, this is an approximation and may not reflect all CAPEX activities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dividends Paid:</strong> ₹44,775 lakhs (approximately ₹4.48 billion or US$540 million approx.) This is explicitly stated in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows under Cash Flow from Financing Activities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Free Cash Flow (FCF):</strong> To calculate FCF, we would typically use the following formula:</p>
<p>FCF = Operating Cash Flow - Capital Expenditures</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>However, as noted above, the report does not clearly state the operating cash flow figure for the consolidated view. While it shows net cash from operating activities as ₹68,375 lakhs, this is after tax payments and may not represent the operating cash flow used for calculating FCF. A precise FCF calculation would require more detailed information from the notes to the financial statements than what is currently available.  A <em>rough estimate</em> could use this number, but remember that this is a simplification and likely an underestimation.</p>
<p><strong>In Summary:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>CAPEX (Estimate):</strong> ₹11,304 lakhs (approximately ₹11.30 billion)</li>
<li><strong>Dividends Paid:</strong> ₹44,775 lakhs (approximately ₹4.48 billion)</li>
<li><strong>Free Cash Flow (Estimate):</strong>  Cannot be accurately calculated with the provided data.  A very rough approximation would subtract the estimated CAPEX from the net cash from operating activities (₹68,375 lakhs - ₹11,304 lakhs = ₹57,071 lakhs).  However, this number is highly unreliable without complete data on operating cash flow and all capital expenditures.</li>
</ul>
<p>For precise figures on FCF and a more accurate determination of CAPEX, refer to the complete, audited financial statements and related notes.</p>

</h3>
<p>The profitability ratios for Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders Limited (MDL) need to be calculated from the data presented in the Consolidated Financial Statements. The report itself doesn&rsquo;t directly provide all these ratios, and some calculations require additional information not explicitly stated.  All financial figures used in the calculations below are taken from the Consolidated Statement of Profit &amp; Loss and Balance Sheet, and values are in ₹ lakhs unless otherwise stated.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong>  The calculations below are based on the available data in the provided report. The auditor&rsquo;s report contains qualifications and therefore the values presented should be seen as preliminary and subject to change after further reconciliation procedures. The financial year is April 1, 2023 to March 31, 2024.</p>
<p><strong>1. Gross Margin:</strong></p>
<p>Gross Margin = (Revenue - Cost of Revenue) / Revenue</p>
<ul>
<li>Revenue: ₹9,46,658 lakhs</li>
<li>Cost of Revenue (Cost of Materials Consumed + Procurement of Base &amp; Depot Spares): ₹6,22,747 lakhs</li>
<li>Gross Profit: ₹3,23,911 lakhs</li>
</ul>
<p>Gross Margin = (₹3,23,911 lakhs / ₹9,46,658 lakhs) * 100% = <strong>34.2%</strong></p>
<p><strong>2. Operating Margin:</strong></p>
<p>Operating Margin = Operating Income / Revenue</p>
<ul>
<li>Revenue: ₹9,46,658 lakhs</li>
<li>Operating Income (Profit Before Tax &amp; Exceptional Items): ₹2,42,483 lakhs</li>
</ul>
<p>Operating Margin = (₹2,42,483 lakhs / ₹9,46,658 lakhs) * 100% = <strong>25.6%</strong></p>
<p><strong>3. Net Profit Margin:</strong></p>
<p>Net Profit Margin = Net Income / Revenue</p>
<ul>
<li>Revenue: ₹9,46,658 lakhs</li>
<li>Net Income (Profit for the year): ₹1,93,697 lakhs</li>
</ul>
<p>Net Profit Margin = (₹1,93,697 lakhs / ₹9,46,658 lakhs) * 100% = <strong>20.5%</strong></p>
<p><strong>4. Return on Equity (ROE):</strong></p>
<p>ROE = Net Income / Average Shareholders&rsquo; Equity</p>
<ul>
<li>Net Income: ₹1,93,697 lakhs</li>
<li>Average Shareholders&rsquo; Equity: (₹4,76,016 lakhs + ₹6,24,347 lakhs) / 2 = ₹5,50,181.5 lakhs</li>
</ul>
<p>ROE = (₹1,93,697 lakhs / ₹5,50,181.5 lakhs) * 100% = <strong>35.2%</strong></p>
<p><strong>5. Return on Assets (ROA):</strong></p>
<p>ROA = Net Income / Average Total Assets</p>
<ul>
<li>Net Income: ₹1,93,697 lakhs</li>
<li>Average Total Assets: (₹2,946,317 lakhs + ₹29,44,881 lakhs) / 2 = ₹16,106,099 lakhs</li>
</ul>
<p>ROA = (₹1,93,697 lakhs / ₹16,20,549 lakhs) * 100% = <strong>1.2%</strong></p>
<p><strong>Important Considerations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>These calculations are based on the figures presented in the Consolidated Financial Statements.  Standalone figures for MDL alone would result in different ratios.</li>
<li>The report uses many approximations and estimations (e.g., the cost of revenue calculation relies on the information available, and there is lack of clarity regarding the operating cashflow figure in the report).</li>
<li>The auditor&rsquo;s report contains qualifications, implying that the financial figures, and thus these calculated ratios, are preliminary and subject to revision.</li>
</ul>
<p>For precise and definitive values, consult the final audited financial statements.  Always exercise caution when using preliminary data.</p>

<p>To calculate liquidity ratios for Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders Limited (MDL), we&rsquo;ll use data from the <strong>Consolidated</strong> Balance Sheet as of March 31, 2024.  Remember that these are preliminary figures, subject to the qualifications in the auditor&rsquo;s report. All figures are in ₹ lakhs.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Current Ratio:</strong> Current Ratio = Current Assets / Current Liabilities</p>
<ul>
<li>Current Assets: ₹2,578,819 lakhs</li>
<li>Current Liabilities: ₹2,263,435 lakhs</li>
</ul>
<p>Current Ratio = ₹2,578,819 lakhs / ₹2,263,435 lakhs = <strong>1.14</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Quick Ratio (Acid-Test Ratio):</strong> Quick Ratio = (Current Assets - Inventories) / Current Liabilities</p>
<ul>
<li>Current Assets: ₹2,578,819 lakhs</li>
<li>Inventories: ₹571,337 lakhs</li>
<li>Current Liabilities: ₹2,263,435 lakhs</li>
</ul>
<p>Quick Ratio = (₹2,578,819 lakhs - ₹571,337 lakhs) / ₹2,263,435 lakhs = <strong>0.89</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cash Ratio:</strong> Cash Ratio = (Cash and Cash Equivalents) / Current Liabilities</p>
<ul>
<li>Cash and Cash Equivalents: ₹352,348 lakhs</li>
<li>Current Liabilities: ₹2,263,435 lakhs</li>
</ul>
<p>Cash Ratio = ₹352,348 lakhs / ₹2,263,435 lakhs = <strong>0.16</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Notes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Consolidated Figures:</strong> These ratios are based on the <em>consolidated</em> financial statements, including the associate company. Standalone ratios for MDL would differ.</li>
<li><strong>Preliminary Data:</strong> The auditor&rsquo;s report contains qualifications, implying that the balance sheet figures used in these calculations are preliminary and may be subject to revision.</li>
<li><strong>Inventory:</strong> The inventory figure used is substantial.  The quick and cash ratios will be especially sensitive to changes in this figure.</li>
<li><strong>Definition of Cash Equivalents:</strong> The specific components included in &ldquo;Cash and Cash Equivalents&rdquo; should be reviewed in the notes to the financial statements to fully understand the calculation of the cash ratio.</li>

  Efficiency Ratios
  <a class="anchor" href="#efficiency-ratios">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Calculating efficiency ratios for Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders Limited (MDL) requires using data from the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2024.  Remember that these are preliminary figures and subject to the qualifications noted in the auditor&rsquo;s report.  All figures are in ₹ lakhs.  Certain calculations require approximations because the necessary data is not explicitly given (average balances and precise cost of goods sold are not directly stated).</p>
<p><strong>1. Asset Turnover:</strong></p>
<p>Asset Turnover = Revenue / Average Total Assets</p>
<ul>
<li>Revenue: ₹9,46,658 lakhs</li>
<li>Average Total Assets: (₹29,46,317 lakhs + ₹29,44,881 lakhs) / 2 ≈ ₹29,45,599 lakhs</li>
</ul>
<p>Asset Turnover = ₹9,46,658 lakhs / ₹29,45,599 lakhs = <strong>0.32</strong></p>
<p><strong>2. Inventory Turnover:</strong></p>
<p>Inventory Turnover = Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory</p>
<ul>
<li>A precise &ldquo;Cost of Goods Sold&rdquo; figure is not explicitly provided in the consolidated statements. We will approximate using the &ldquo;Cost of Materials Consumed&rdquo; which is ₹508,164 lakhs, plus the &ldquo;Procurement of base and depot spares&rdquo; which is ₹114,583 lakhs, for a total approximate cost of goods sold of ₹622,747 lakhs.</li>
<li>Average Inventory: (₹7,35,686 lakhs + ₹5,71,337 lakhs) / 2 ≈ ₹6,53,511.5 lakhs</li>
</ul>
<p>Inventory Turnover = ₹6,22,747 lakhs / ₹6,53,511.5 lakhs = <strong>0.95</strong></p>
<p><strong>3. Receivables Turnover:</strong></p>
<p>Receivables Turnover = Revenue / Average Accounts Receivable</p>
<ul>
<li>Revenue: ₹9,46,658 lakhs</li>
<li>Average Accounts Receivable: (₹1,00,233 lakhs + ₹1,84,693 lakhs) / 2 ≈ ₹1,42,463 lakhs</li>
</ul>
<p>Receivables Turnover = ₹9,46,658 lakhs / ₹1,42,463 lakhs = <strong>6.65</strong></p>
<p><strong>Important Notes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Approximations:</strong> The calculations for inventory turnover and receivables turnover involve approximations due to the lack of explicitly stated average balances and a precisely defined cost of goods sold in the consolidated statements.</li>
<li><strong>Consolidated Data:</strong> The ratios are based on the <em>consolidated</em> financial statements and therefore include the financial information of Goa Shipyard Limited.  Standalone figures would differ.</li>
<li><strong>Preliminary Figures:</strong> The data used for the calculations is preliminary and subject to the qualifications mentioned in the auditor&rsquo;s report.  The final audited numbers might result in different ratios.</li>
<li><strong>Industry Comparison:</strong> To properly interpret these ratios, they should be benchmarked against industry averages and the performance of MDL&rsquo;s competitors.</li>
</ul>
<p>It&rsquo;s essential to consult the final audited financial statements and accompanying notes for precise figures and a more thorough understanding of the company&rsquo;s performance.  These calculations should be considered estimates only.</p>

  Leverage Ratios
  <a class="anchor" href="#leverage-ratios">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Calculating use ratios for Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders Limited (MDL) requires careful analysis of the Consolidated Balance Sheet, as the report doesn&rsquo;t explicitly provide these ratios.  It&rsquo;s essential to remember that the figures used are preliminary, as indicated in the auditor&rsquo;s report.  All values are in ₹ lakhs.</p>
<p><strong>1. Debt-to-Equity Ratio:</strong></p>
<p>Debt-to-Equity Ratio = Total Debt / Total Shareholders&rsquo; Equity</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Total Debt:</strong> MDL&rsquo;s report doesn&rsquo;t explicitly state total debt as a single figure. We need to approximate this from the balance sheet.  The closest approximation is the sum of all liabilities, excluding equity (as presented in the balance sheet).  Therefore, total debt is approximately ₹2,320,534 lakhs.</li>
<li><strong>Total Shareholders&rsquo; Equity:</strong> ₹624,347 lakhs</li>
</ul>
<p>Debt-to-Equity Ratio = ₹2,320,534 lakhs / ₹624,347 lakhs = <strong>3.72</strong></p>
<p><strong>2. Debt-to-Assets Ratio:</strong></p>
<p>Debt-to-Assets Ratio = Total Debt / Total Assets</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Total Debt (Approximation):</strong> ₹2,320,534 lakhs (as explained above).</li>
<li><strong>Total Assets:</strong> ₹29,44,881 lakhs</li>
</ul>
<p>Debt-to-Assets Ratio = ₹2,320,534 lakhs / ₹29,44,881 lakhs = <strong>0.08</strong></p>
<p><strong>3. Interest Coverage Ratio:</strong></p>
<p>Interest Coverage Ratio = Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT) / Interest Expense</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>EBIT:</strong>  This isn&rsquo;t directly stated, but can be approximated. We&rsquo;ll start with Profit Before Tax (PBT)  from the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss: ₹2,42,483 lakhs.  Then, we need to add back the tax expense and any non-cash interest expense to arrive at the EBIT figure.</li>
<li><strong>Tax Expense:</strong> ₹61,441 lakhs (from the income tax expense note).</li>
<li><strong>Interest Expense:</strong> ₹512 lakhs (from the finance cost note).</li>
</ul>
<p>EBIT ≈ ₹2,42,483 lakhs + ₹61,441 lakhs + ₹512 lakhs = ₹3,04,436 lakhs</p>
<p>Interest Coverage Ratio = ₹3,04,436 lakhs / ₹512 lakhs = <strong>594.62</strong></p>
<p><strong>Important Notes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Approximations:</strong> The calculations above involve significant approximations, especially in determining total debt and EBIT.  This is due to the lack of clearly presented figures for certain items in the Consolidated Financial Statements.</li>
<li><strong>Consolidated Data:</strong> The ratios are based on the consolidated financial statements and include the financial information of the associate company.  Standalone ratios would be substantially different.</li>
<li><strong>Preliminary Data:</strong> The financial data used in these calculations is preliminary and subject to revisions following the completion of the reconciliation and confirmation processes mentioned in the auditor&rsquo;s report.</li>
<li><strong>Debt Definition:</strong>  The definition of &ldquo;debt&rdquo; used here is an approximation, since a specific figure for &ldquo;Total Debt&rdquo; is not included in the report.  Further analysis of the notes to the financial statements might be required for a more accurate representation.</li>
</ul>
<p>For precise and validated use ratios, always refer to the final audited financial statements and accompanying notes.  These calculations should be viewed as estimates only and should not be used in isolation without further due diligence.</p>

  Market Metrics
  <a class="anchor" href="#market-metrics">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Several of the requested market metrics require information not directly provided in the Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders Limited (MDL) annual report.  We can only provide estimates or indicate how these would be calculated if the necessary data were available.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Market Capitalization (Market Cap):</strong> Market Cap is calculated as the current market price per share multiplied by the total number of outstanding shares.  The annual report provides the number of outstanding shares (20,16,90,000), but the current market price per share is not included. Therefore, we <strong>cannot</strong> calculate the market cap.  You would need to obtain the current share price from a financial website such as the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) or the National Stock Exchange of India (NSE) to perform this calculation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Price-to-Earnings Ratio (PE Ratio):</strong> PE Ratio = Market Price per Share / Earnings Per Share (EPS)</p>
<ul>
<li>The annual report provides the EPS (₹96.04 for both basic and diluted), but the current market price per share is missing.  Therefore, we <strong>cannot</strong> compute the PE ratio. You would need to obtain the current market price from a financial website.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Price-to-Book Ratio (PB Ratio):</strong> PB Ratio = Market Price per Share / Book Value per Share</p>
<ul>
<li>The annual report states the book value per share (₹276.20), but, again, the current market price per share is missing. Therefore, we <strong>cannot</strong> calculate the PB ratio. You will need the current market price from a financial data provider.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dividend Yield:</strong> Dividend Yield = Annual Dividend per Share / Market Price per Share</p>
<ul>
<li>The annual report states the total dividend per share (₹27.45) for the financial year.  However, the current market price per share is unavailable.  Therefore, we <strong>cannot</strong> calculate the dividend yield.  You would need to acquire the current market price.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dividend Payout Ratio:</strong> Dividend Payout Ratio = Dividends Paid / Net Income</p>
<ul>
<li>Total Dividends Paid (Consolidated): ₹55,363 lakhs (From the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows)</li>
<li>Net Income (Consolidated): ₹1,93,697 lakhs (From the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss)</li>
</ul>
<p>Dividend Payout Ratio = ₹55,363 lakhs / ₹1,93,697 lakhs = <strong>28.6%</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>In Summary:</strong></p>
<p>Only the dividend payout ratio can be calculated with the data provided in the annual report.  The market cap, PE ratio, PB ratio, and dividend yield require the current market price per share, which is not included in the report and must be obtained from an external source. Remember that all calculations are based on preliminary data and are subject to the qualifications noted in the auditor&rsquo;s report.</p>

  Segment Analysis
  <a class="anchor" href="#segment-analysis">#</a>
</h3>
<p>The Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders Limited (MDL) annual report doesn&rsquo;t provide a detailed segmental breakdown conforming to standard financial reporting practices.  The report mentions two main operating areas, but doesn&rsquo;t offer a precise breakdown of revenues, operating margins, or market share by segment.  We can only offer a partial analysis based on the available information.  All financial figures are in ₹ lakhs unless otherwise specified.</p>
<p><strong>Business Segments:</strong></p>
<p>The report indicates MDL operates primarily in two segments:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Shipbuilding:</strong> This segment encompasses the construction of various types of ships including warships (destroyers, frigates, corvettes, missile boats) and offshore patrol vessels for the Indian Navy and Coast Guard, as well as commercial vessels for export markets.  MDL explicitly highlights its role as the lead shipyard for major surface combatants and its unique position as the only shipyard in India with two independent submarine launch lines.</li>
<li><strong>Submarine and Heavy Engineering:</strong>  This segment focuses on the design, construction, repair, and refit of submarines, predominantly for the Indian Navy. MDL is uniquely positioned as the only Indian shipyard capable of building both destroyers and conventional submarines.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Data Limitations:</strong></p>
<p>The provided annual report significantly restricts a complete segmental analysis.  The document does <em>not</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide separate revenue figures for each segment.  Total revenue is stated as ₹9,46,658 lakhs, but this is not broken down by segment.</li>
<li>Provide operating margin data for each segment.  The consolidated operating margin (25.6%) is given, but a segmental breakdown is absent.</li>
<li>Offer any market share data for either segment.  The report doesn&rsquo;t state MDL&rsquo;s market share in the Indian shipbuilding or submarine construction markets.</li>
<li>Give a precise list of key products within each segment.  While the report mentions many vessel types, it doesn&rsquo;t specify the number of each type produced or their individual contribution to revenue.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Partial Analysis (Based on Available Information):</strong></p>
<p>Given the information gaps in the provided report, a complete segmental analysis is impossible.  However, we can make some observations:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shipbuilding Revenue is Likely Dominant:</strong> Considering MDL&rsquo;s status as a lead shipyard for major surface combatants and its various product offerings in this segment, it is highly likely that the Shipbuilding segment contributes a substantially larger share of overall revenue compared to the Submarine and Heavy Engineering segment.  However, quantifying this requires more detailed financial data.</li>
<li><strong>High Growth Rates (Overall):</strong> The report highlights significant overall revenue growth.  It&rsquo;s reasonable to assume that both segments contributed to this growth, though the relative contribution of each remains unknown.</li>
<li><strong>Geographic Presence:</strong> MDL&rsquo;s primary geographic presence is national, focusing on India.  The report mentions export orders, but does not provide details on the specific countries where these exports are directed.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>To obtain a more detailed segmental analysis, you would need to:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Access the complete audited financial statements and related notes to the financial statements, which may provide additional segment-specific information.</li>
<li>Consult industry reports and market research data on the Indian shipbuilding and submarine construction industries, allowing for a better understanding of MDL&rsquo;s market position.</li>
</ol>
<p>Without access to more detailed financial data, the analysis of MDL&rsquo;s business segments remains incomplete.</p>
<h3 class="heading" id="risk-assessment">
  Risk Assessment
  <a class="anchor" href="#risk-assessment">#</a>
</h3>
<p>The Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders Limited (MDL) annual report identifies many key risk factors, although it doesn&rsquo;t explicitly categorize them or provide a detailed assessment of likelihood and impact severity using a standardized framework. We can, however, analyze the disclosed risks, offering a structured overview based on the information provided.</p>
<p><strong>I. Risk Factor Categories and Descriptions:</strong></p>
<p>We can group the identified risk factors into these categories:</p>
<p><strong>A. Operational Risks:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Project Delays and Cost Overruns:</strong>  The complex nature of shipbuilding and submarine construction, coupled with dependencies on multiple suppliers and subcontractors, makes projects susceptible to delays and cost overruns.  This risk is exacerbated by potential design changes, material shortages, and unforeseen technical challenges.</li>
<li><strong>Supply Chain Disruptions:</strong> Reliance on both domestic and international suppliers for raw materials, equipment, and specialized components exposes MDL to potential disruptions caused by geopolitical instability, natural disasters, pandemics, and logistical issues.</li>
<li><strong>Unsatisfactory Quality of Work:</strong>  Subcontractors&rsquo; performance and adherence to quality standards directly affect MDL&rsquo;s ability to deliver high-quality products on time.  Poor workmanship could lead to rework, delays, and reputational damage.</li>
<li><strong>Shortage of Skilled Workforce:</strong> The specialized nature of shipbuilding necessitates a highly skilled workforce.  Finding and retaining qualified personnel, especially in niche areas, is essential and competitive labor markets might pose challenges.</li>
<li><strong>Technological Change:</strong>  Rapid advancements in shipbuilding technology require continuous investment in R&amp;D to stay competitive and maintain operational efficiency.  Failure to adapt to technological changes could affect the company&rsquo;s ability to win new contracts.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>B. Financial Risks:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Liquidity Risk:</strong> Managing liquidity effectively, especially while handling large-scale projects with long lead times, is paramount.  Unexpected delays or cost overruns could strain cash flows.</li>
<li><strong>Foreign Exchange Risk:</strong>  MDL&rsquo;s involvement in international trade exposes it to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, which could impact the cost of imports and the profitability of export orders. Although this risk is mitigated by contractual clauses in many cases, exchange rate fluctuations are inherently uncontrollable.</li>
<li><strong>Credit Risk:</strong>  While most receivables are from the Indian Government,  the risk of non-payment or delayed payments from customers remains a potential concern.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>C. External Risks:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Geopolitical and Economic Uncertainties:</strong> Global events, including political instability, economic downturns, and trade wars, influence the overall demand for ships and submarines and create market volatility.</li>
<li><strong>Government Regulations:</strong> Stringent regulatory requirements and changes in government policies, especially in the defense sector, may create compliance challenges and impact project timelines.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>II.  Impact Severity, Likelihood, and Mitigation Strategies (Qualitative Assessment):</strong></p>
<p>The  annual report  does  not  provide  a  quantitative  assessment  of  risk likelihood and impact severity.  Therefore, a qualitative assessment based on the report&rsquo;s tone and information is provided below:</p>

</h3>
<p>The provided Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders Limited (MDL) annual report does <strong>not</strong> include ESG ratings from any external rating agencies.  The report details MDL&rsquo;s ESG initiatives and performance but doesn&rsquo;t cite any scores or ratings from organizations such as MSCI, Sustainalytics, Refinitiv, etc.  To find ESG ratings for MDL, you would need to consult independent ESG rating providers directly or utilize financial databases that aggregate such ratings.</p>
<h3 class="heading" id="esg-initiatives">
  ESG Initiatives
  <a class="anchor" href="#esg-initiatives">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders Limited&rsquo;s (MDL) Annual Report for 2023-24 highlights various Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) initiatives, though it doesn&rsquo;t explicitly define specific, quantifiable sustainability goals with set timeframes.  Let&rsquo;s break down the key aspects:</p>
<p><strong>I. Environmental Initiatives:</strong></p>
<p>MDL&rsquo;s environmental initiatives focus on reducing its ecological footprint through many key actions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Renewable Energy:</strong> Installation of a 1.85 MWp rooftop solar power plant across various facilities, aiming to significantly reduce reliance on fossil fuels and decrease greenhouse gas emissions.  The report quantifies the electricity generated from solar power as 50 Lakh Mega Joule in FY23-24, representing 11% of total consumption, and shows CO2 emissions under Scope 2 decreased.</li>
<li><strong>Water Management:</strong> Implementation of sewage treatment plants and greywater treatment plants to optimize water usage and prevent water pollution.  A Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) system in the Submarine Section Assembly workshop further minimizes water consumption and promotes water reuse.</li>
<li><strong>Waste Management:</strong>  MDL strives for a &ldquo;zero garbage&rdquo; status and has waste management practices in place.  This includes engaging with NGOs to manage daily waste removal, establishing separate contracts for various types of scrap, promoting plastic waste recycling, and employing an auction system for metal and wooden scrap.</li>
<li><strong>Air Emissions:</strong> The report mentions efforts to minimize air emissions related to diesel engines and sea trials but doesn&rsquo;t provide specific quantitative data on emissions levels or reduction targets.</li>
<li><strong>Energy Efficiency:</strong> MDL emphasizes energy conservation through the use of energy-efficient motors and LED lighting.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>II. Carbon Footprint:</strong></p>
<p>The report provides some data related to the company&rsquo;s carbon footprint, especially concerning Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, and mentions a decrease in Scope 2 emissions. However, a complete carbon footprint assessment, covering Scope 3 emissions, is absent.  Specific reduction targets for the future are also not outlined. The company states they are working towards establishing more detailed ESG targets for upcoming years.  The available data includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Scope 1 Emissions:</strong> 505.30 metric tonnes of CO2 equivalent in FY2023-24.</li>
<li><strong>Scope 2 Emissions:</strong> 9760.69 metric tonnes of CO2 equivalent in FY2023-24.</li>
</ul>
<p>The report also states that CO2 emissions under scope 2 decreased.</p>
<p><strong>III. Social Initiatives:</strong></p>
<p>MDL&rsquo;s social initiatives are primarily channeled through its Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) program. Key areas of focus include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Education:</strong> Support for underprivileged students and the establishment of tuition centers for slum children.</li>
<li><strong>Healthcare:</strong>  Support for government hospitals, initiatives to address malnutrition and anemia, and cancer care programs.</li>
<li><strong>Skill Development:</strong>  Training programs for apprentices and efforts to promote entrepreneurship, especially among marginalized groups.</li>
<li><strong>Community Development:</strong> Initiatives targeting aspirational districts, focused on health, sanitation, and infrastructure improvements.  These include screening for sickle cell anemia and raising awareness about malnutrition.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>IV. Governance Practices:</strong></p>
<p>MDL&rsquo;s governance practices focus on transparency, accountability, and ethical conduct. This is evidenced by:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Board Committees:</strong> Establishment of various board committees (Audit, Nomination &amp; Remuneration, Stakeholders Relationship, Risk Management, CSR) to oversee various aspects of the business and ensure compliance with regulations.</li>
<li><strong>Vigilance Mechanism:</strong>  A robust vigilance system to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.</li>
<li><strong>Compliance:</strong> Adherence to SEBI regulations, DPE guidelines, and other applicable laws and regulations.</li>
<li><strong>Whistleblower Policy:</strong>  A policy in place to encourage reporting of unethical conduct and potential wrongdoings.</li>
<li><strong>Code of Conduct:</strong> A formal code of conduct for Board members and senior management, setting ethical standards.</li>
<li><strong>Stakeholder Engagement:</strong> Regular engagement with stakeholders (including investors, employees, customers, and communities) to solicit feedback and address concerns.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>V. Sustainability Goals:</strong></p>
<p>The annual report lacks clearly defined, quantifiable sustainability goals with specific timelines.  While the report highlights various ESG initiatives, it does not provide concrete targets for emission reductions, resource efficiency improvements, or social impact measurements for future years.  The report implies that the development of such targets is underway.  This lack of explicit sustainability goals makes it difficult to assess the long-term sustainability strategy of MDL.  The management indicates they are working toward this.</p>
<p>In conclusion, while MDL demonstrates a commitment to ESG principles through various initiatives, the lack of clearly articulated and measurable sustainability goals with defined timelines limits the ability to comprehensively evaluate its long-term sustainability strategy and effectiveness.  Future reports should ideally include such goals and progress reporting for greater transparency.</p>
