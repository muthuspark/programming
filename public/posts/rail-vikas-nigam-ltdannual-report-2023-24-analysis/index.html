  Analysis of Accounting Quality and Regulatory Risk Assessment
  <a class="anchor" href="#analysis-of-accounting-quality-and-regulatory-risk-assessment">#</a>
</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Accounting Quality:</strong> The emphasis of matter in the auditor&rsquo;s report regarding significant receivables from KRCL and non-raising of departmental charges indicate a potential area of concern regarding revenue recognition and recoverability, impacting the quality of earnings, however, management does not expect any material impact. The pending confirmation/reconciliation of balances also highlights an area that needs improvement in the Company&rsquo;s accounting processes. The adoption of accounting policies consistent with Ind AS suggests a commitment to high-quality financial reporting.</li>
<li><strong>Regulatory Risk Assessment:</strong> The primary regulatory risk stems from the non-compliance with SEBI (LODR) Regulations regarding the composition of the Board of Directors. The ongoing legal and tax disputes represent a moderate regulatory risk, but the Company&rsquo;s assertion that these claims are reimbursable by clients mitigates the immediate financial impact. The pending appeals and representations suggest the Company is actively managing these risks. The adherence to GeM procurement and MSE policies demonstrates compliance in these areas.</li>
<li>The lack of a diversified Board of Directors represents regulatory risk.</li>
