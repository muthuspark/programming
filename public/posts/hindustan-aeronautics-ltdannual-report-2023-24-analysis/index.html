  Analysis of Accounting Quality and Regulatory Risk Assessment
  <a class="anchor" href="#analysis-of-accounting-quality-and-regulatory-risk-assessment">#</a>
</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Accounting Quality:</strong> The use of Ind AS and the clean audit opinion indicates a high standard of accounting quality. Emphasis of Matter paragraphs highlight areas requiring attention, but the auditors haven&rsquo;t qualified their opinion, suggesting these are being appropriately managed and disclosed. Regular review of accounting policies, the use of actuarial valuations for employee benefits, and inventory redundancy provisions demonstrate a commitment to accurate financial reporting.</li>
<li><strong>Regulatory Risk:</strong> The primary area of regulatory risk lies in the non-compliance with Board composition requirements under SEBI (LODR) Regulations. While the Company is actively pursuing appointments, the pending fines from stock exchanges pose a financial risk. Furthermore, reliance on government contracts and defense sector policies makes the Company susceptible to changes in government spending and procurement procedures. The Company&rsquo;s compliance with environmental regulations and other laws indicates a low risk in those areas.</li>
