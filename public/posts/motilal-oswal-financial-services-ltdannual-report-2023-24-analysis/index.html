  Strategic Risks
  <a class="anchor" href="#strategic-risks">#</a>
</h3>
<p><strong>Severity:</strong> High. The Indian economy&rsquo;s projected growth and increasing equity market participation present significant opportunities, but intense competition from local and global financial service providers represents a substantial threat.</p>
<p><strong>Likelihood:</strong> High. Competition in the Indian financial services market is demonstrably increasing, as evidenced by the growth in demat accounts and activity in IPOs, QIPs, and block deals.</p>
<p><strong>Trend:</strong> Increasing. The financial services sector&rsquo;s share of disposable income is growing, making the market more attractive and thus more competitive.</p>
<p><strong>Mitigation Strategies:</strong> Diversification of business into liner sources of earnings (Asset and Wealth Management, Housing Finance), investment in technology (RISE Super App), expansion of distribution capabilities, and strategic allocation of capital to long-term RoE enhancing opportunities.</p>
<p><strong>Control Effectiveness:</strong> Partially Effective. The Company shows resilience across business verticals, with notable growth in AUM and client base. However, competition remains a significant factor that will determine the long term and consistent efficiency of risk controls.</p>
<p><strong>Potential Financial Impact:</strong> Significant. Failure to adapt to market changes and competition could result in loss of market share and reduced profitability, as evidenced by the fluctuations in operating margins.</p>
<h3 class="heading" id="operational-risks">
  Operational Risks
  <a class="anchor" href="#operational-risks">#</a>
</h3>
<p><strong>Severity:</strong> Moderate to High. The reliance on technology and digital platforms, particularly in the capital markets segment, exposes the Company to operational disruptions, and systems failure.</p>
<p><strong>Likelihood:</strong> Moderate. The operational infrastructure is robust, but technological dependence inherently increases risk probability.</p>
<p><strong>Trend:</strong> Stable. The Company is investing in technology upgrades and digital solutions to improve efficiency and client experience.</p>
<p><strong>Mitigation Strategies:</strong> Investment in technology upgrades, implementation of digital solutions, and a robust risk management framework including a Business Continuity &amp; Disaster Recovery Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Control Effectiveness:</strong> Moderate. While investments are being made, the inherent risk in technology-dependent operations remains.</p>
<p><strong>Potential Financial Impact:</strong> Moderate to High. Operational disruptions can lead to direct financial losses, reputational damage, and client attrition.</p>
<h3 class="heading" id="financial-risks">
  Financial Risks
  <a class="anchor" href="#financial-risks">#</a>
</h3>
<p><strong>Severity:</strong> Moderate. Market volatility directly impacts the Company&rsquo;s treasury book, which is 100% invested in equity and equity products.</p>
<p><strong>Likelihood:</strong> High. Market volatility is inherent in the equity markets. The reported Profit After Tax (PAT) is volatile due to marked-to-market gains or losses.</p>
<p><strong>Trend:</strong> Fluctuating. The Company&rsquo;s treasury investments have delivered an 18.3% XIRR, but significant fluctuations exist.</p>
<p><strong>Mitigation Strategies:</strong> Diversified business model (Capital Markets, Asset &amp; Private Wealth Management, Housing Finance), reinvestment of operating profits in treasury, and use of the treasury book as collateral for core business.</p>
<p><strong>Control Effectiveness:</strong> Partially Effective. The Company&rsquo;s business model and reinvestment strategy have historically yielded a robustly compounded net worth, showing some resilience, but exposure to market volatility remains.</p>
<p><strong>Potential Financial Impact:</strong> High. Significant market downturns can substantially impact the value of the treasury book, affecting net worth and potentially requiring additional capital infusion.</p>

<p><strong>Mitigation Strategies:</strong> Enhanced compliance and risk management frameworks, dedicated Risk Management Committee, implementation of policies for insider trading, prevention of sexual harassment, whistleblower protection, and CSR.</p>
<p><strong>Control Effectiveness:</strong> High. The company maintains a robust supervisory board, a dedicated Risk Management Committee, and comprehensive policies. The Company demonstrates compliance with applicable Secretarial Standards, Listing Regulations, and Code of Conduct. No instances of non-compliance were identified in the last financial year.</p>
<p><strong>Potential Financial Impact:</strong> Moderate. Non-compliance can lead to penalties, sanctions, and reputational damage.</p>

<li><strong>Accounting Quality:</strong> Consistent application of accounting policies, compliance with Ind AS, and the use of external auditors suggest a high level of accounting quality. Detailed disclosures on key estimates and judgments also enhance transparency.</li>
<li><strong>Regulatory Risk:</strong> The Company appears to be in compliance with most regulations. The presence of a robust risk management framework and active engagement with regulators suggest a proactive approach to managing regulatory risk. However, pending legal and tax matters represent a potential, albeit low, regulatory risk. The Company&rsquo;s registration with SEBI and membership of various exchanges add to a higher level of regulatory scrutiny.</li>
