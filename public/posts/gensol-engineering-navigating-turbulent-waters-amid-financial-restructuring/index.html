    <p>Let me tell you about Gensol Engineering, a stock that&rsquo;s been through a wild ride lately. As a retail investor watching this company, I&rsquo;ve seen quite a drama unfold in the past few months. Once a market darling, Gensol&rsquo;s stock has crashed by more than 70% in just nine months! That&rsquo;s enough to make any investor break into a cold sweat.</p>

  The Big Credit Rating Crash
  <a class="anchor" href="#the-big-credit-rating-crash">#</a>
</h2>
<p>So what happened? In early March 2025, two credit rating agencies (CARE and ICRA) suddenly downgraded Gensol&rsquo;s loans to &ldquo;default&rdquo; status. Basically, they said the company was having trouble paying its loans on time. Even worse, ICRA claimed Gensol had &ldquo;apparently falsified&rdquo; information about its debt payments. Yikes!</p>
<p>This news sent the stock into a nosedive, dropping 40% in just five days. The stock hit a 52-week low of ₹307.25 last Friday before slightly recovering to ₹327.</p>
<h2 class="heading" id="money-problems-too-much-debt">
  Money Problems: Too Much Debt
  <a class="anchor" href="#money-problems-too-much-debt">#</a>
</h2>
<p>The main issue here is simple - Gensol has borrowed too much money. They have debts of ₹1,146 crore but reserves of only ₹589 crore. That gives them a debt-to-equity ratio of about 1.95, which is pretty high. Every month, they need to pay about ₹20 crore just to service their debt!</p>
<p>What really worries me as an investor is that about 82% of the promoters&rsquo; shares are pledged as loan collateral. That&rsquo;s up from 80% last September. When promoters pledge that much of their holdings, it&rsquo;s usually not a good sign. And their subsidiary BluSmart Mobility isn&rsquo;t doing well either - it recently defaulted on some of its own debt.</p>
<h2 class="heading" id="managements-plan-to-fix-things">
  Management&rsquo;s Plan to Fix Things
  <a class="anchor" href="#managements-plan-to-fix-things">#</a>
</h2>
<p>To their credit, Gensol&rsquo;s management hasn&rsquo;t just been sitting around. They&rsquo;re claiming this is just a &ldquo;temporary liquidity mismatch&rdquo; that&rsquo;s improving as customers pay their bills. They&rsquo;ve denied the &ldquo;falsification&rdquo; allegations and set up a committee to investigate.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve also announced a plan to cut their debt by ₹665 crore by:</p>
<ol>
<li>Selling nearly 3,000 electric vehicles for ₹315 crore</li>
<li>Selling a subsidiary company for ₹350 crore</li>
</ol>
<p>If they pull this off, their debt-equity ratio would drop to 0.8, which would be much healthier. They say they&rsquo;ve already paid off ₹230 crore of debt this year.</p>
<h2 class="heading" id="shaking-things-up">
  Shaking Things Up
  <a class="anchor" href="#shaking-things-up">#</a>
</h2>
<p>In the middle of all this, their CFO Ankit Jain resigned on March 6th, citing &ldquo;personal reasons.&rdquo; They quickly appointed a new CFO, Jabirmahendi Aga, who has worked with Gensol before.</p>
<p>The company is also taking some interesting steps to raise money:</p>
<ul>
<li>They&rsquo;re considering a 1:10 stock split on March 13th</li>
<li>They&rsquo;re looking at issuing new shares and bonds</li>
<li>The promoters sold 2.37% of the company (9 lakh shares) and promised to put that money back into the business</li>
</ul>
<p>After selling those shares, the promoters still own about 60% of the company, so they definitely have skin in the game.</p>
<h2 class="heading" id="the-business-itself-looks-good">
  The Business Itself Looks Good
  <a class="anchor" href="#the-business-itself-looks-good">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s interesting - despite all these financial problems, Gensol&rsquo;s actual business seems to be doing well! In the last quarter, their sales went up 30% to ₹345 crore, and profits increased 6% to ₹18 crore compared to the same quarter last year.</p>
<p>For the first nine months of the financial year, things look even better:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sales up 42% to ₹1,056 crore</li>
<li>EBITDA (operating profit) up 89% to ₹246 crore</li>
<li>Net profit up 34% to ₹67 crore</li>
</ul>
<p>They also claim to have an order book worth ₹7,000 crore, which should mean good revenue for years to come - if they can get the money to execute these projects.</p>
<h2 class="heading" id="whats-next-for-gensol">
  What&rsquo;s Next for Gensol?
  <a class="anchor" href="#whats-next-for-gensol">#</a>
</h2>
<p>As a retail investor watching this stock, I see several things Gensol needs to do to turn things around:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Pay their debts on time</strong>: They need to show banks and investors they can handle their loan payments consistently.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Convert orders to cash</strong>: Having a ₹7,000 crore order book sounds great, but they need money to complete these projects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Reduce those pledged shares</strong>: The promoters need to find a way to get their shares out of hock.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Come clean about the allegations</strong>: That committee they formed needs to address the accusations about misreporting finances.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Gensol works in renewable energy and electric mobility - two sectors with massive growth potential in India. They&rsquo;ve completed over 770 MW of solar projects since they started in 2012. The business model makes sense, but they&rsquo;ve clearly taken on too much debt too quickly.</p>
<p>For me as an investor, this situation is a good reminder to look beyond just growth numbers and pay attention to things like debt levels, promoter pledging, and governance issues - especially for companies that recently moved from SME exchanges to the main market.</p>
<p>Will Gensol engineer a comeback? Only time will tell. But I&rsquo;ll be watching their debt reduction plan closely over the next few months before making any decisions about this stock.</p>
