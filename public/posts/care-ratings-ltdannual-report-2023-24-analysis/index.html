  Key Observations:

</h5>
<ul>
<li><strong>Strong Operating Cash Flow:</strong> CareEdge consistently generates strong operating cash flow, driven by its core rating business. The significant increase in OCF for FY24 is due to higher profit and positive contributions from working capital management.</li>
<li><strong>Significant Investing Activities:</strong> The large outflows in investing activities are primarily driven by the purchases/redemptions of investments.</li>
<li><strong>Financing Activities - Dividends and Buyback:</strong> The company distributes a significant portion of its earnings to shareholders through dividends.</li>

<li><strong>Contract Assets &amp; Liabilities:</strong> The document indicates the presence of contract assets and liabilities.
<ul>
<li>Increase in other current liabilities due to increase in Contract Liabilities from 1886.39 to 2832.68.</li>
<li>Decrease in Trade Receivables and increase in Revenue from operations which indicates improved collection efficiency.</li>

  Debt Service Coverage

<p>CareEdge is a &ldquo;Debt Free Company.&rdquo; Therefore, traditional debt service coverage ratios are not applicable. There are lease liabilities, but the interest and principal payments on these are relatively small compared to the operating cash flow.</p>

The current ratio (current assets/current liabilities) improved from 7.71 in FY23 to 6.55 in FY24, which is very high.</li>

<li><strong>Industry Averages:</strong> Without industry data, it&rsquo;s impossible to say whether these ratios are &ldquo;good&rdquo; or &ldquo;bad&rdquo; in a relative sense. Credit rating agencies might have different financial profiles than other types of businesses.</li>
<li><strong>Qualitative Factors:</strong> This analysis is purely quantitative. A full financial assessment would require looking at qualitative factors (management quality, regulatory environment, competitive landscape, etc.).</li>
