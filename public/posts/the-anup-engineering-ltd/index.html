  <meta property="og:description" content="Overview # Comprehensive Analysis # This analysis examines Anup Engineering Limited’s (Anup) annual report for the fiscal year 2023-24, covering financial performance, business segments, risks, and ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) initiatives.
I. Financial Performance:
Anup demonstrated significant year-over-year (YoY) growth in FY2023-24. Key highlights (in Lakhs):
Revenue from Operations: ₹550.38 Cr (34% YoY growth) - This substantial increase points to strong market demand for Anup’s products. Total Income: ₹559.45 Cr (34% YoY growth) – Includes both revenue from operations and other income. EBITDA: ₹126.90 Cr (53% YoY growth) - A higher EBITDA margin (23.03% vs. 20.11% in FY2022-23) indicates improved operational efficiency and profitability. PAT: ₹103.47 Cr (almost doubled YoY) - Significantly improved profitability, reflecting successful cost management and revenue growth. Order Book: ₹854 Cr at the year-end – A robust order book suggests continued strong demand and revenue visibility for FY2024-25. 57% of this order book is from exports. Working Capital: Average 4 turns – Efficient working capital management, driven by consistent revenue generation, good collections, and better customer advances. Restated FY2022-23 Figures: The report notes that FY2022-23 figures are restated due to the merger of Anup Heavy Engineering Limited (a wholly-owned subsidiary) with Anup, effective April 1, 2022. This merger significantly impacts the comparability of year-over-year growth figures.">

<p>This analysis examines Anup Engineering Limited&rsquo;s (Anup) annual report for the fiscal year 2023-24, covering financial performance, business segments, risks, and ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) initiatives.</p>
<p><strong>I. Financial Performance:</strong></p>
<p>Anup demonstrated significant year-over-year (YoY) growth in FY2023-24.  Key highlights (in Lakhs):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Revenue from Operations:</strong> ₹550.38 Cr (34% YoY growth) - This substantial increase points to strong market demand for Anup&rsquo;s products.</li>
<li><strong>Total Income:</strong> ₹559.45 Cr (34% YoY growth) – Includes both revenue from operations and other income.</li>
<li><strong>EBITDA:</strong> ₹126.90 Cr (53% YoY growth) -  A higher EBITDA margin (23.03% vs. 20.11% in FY2022-23) indicates improved operational efficiency and profitability.</li>
<li><strong>PAT:</strong> ₹103.47 Cr (almost doubled YoY) -  Significantly improved profitability, reflecting successful cost management and revenue growth.</li>
<li><strong>Order Book:</strong> ₹854 Cr at the year-end – A robust order book suggests continued strong demand and revenue visibility for FY2024-25.  57% of this order book is from exports.</li>
<li><strong>Working Capital:</strong> Average 4 turns –  Efficient working capital management, driven by consistent revenue generation, good collections, and better customer advances.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Restated FY2022-23 Figures:</strong> The report notes that FY2022-23 figures are restated due to the merger of Anup Heavy Engineering Limited (a wholly-owned subsidiary) with Anup, effective April 1, 2022. This merger significantly impacts the comparability of year-over-year growth figures.</p>
<p><strong>Key Financial Ratios (from MD&amp;A):</strong></p>
<p>The MD&amp;A provides a valuable summary of key financial ratios that show the impact of various business decisions.  These ratios highlight positive developments in profitability and efficiency:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Debtors Turnover Ratio:</strong> Increased to 3.99 times (from 3.01 times), signifying faster collection of receivables.</li>
<li><strong>Operating Profit Margin:</strong> Improved to 21.5% (from 17.36%), indicating better control over operating expenses.</li>
<li><strong>Net Profit Margin:</strong> Significantly increased to 18.8% (from 12.5%), demonstrating strong profitability.</li>
<li><strong>Return on Net Worth:</strong>  Increased to 19.58% (from 11.75%), showcasing increased returns on equity.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>II. Business Segments:</strong></p>
<p>Anup operates primarily in the <strong>engineering products</strong> segment, manufacturing process equipment for various industries:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Oil &amp; Gas:</strong>  Heat exchangers, reactors, pressure vessels, columns &amp; towers.</li>
<li><strong>Petrochemicals:</strong> Similar equipment as Oil &amp; Gas.</li>
<li><strong>LNG:</strong> Specialized equipment for liquefied natural gas processing.</li>
<li><strong>Fertilizers:</strong> Reactors and related equipment.</li>
<li><strong>Chemicals:</strong> A broad range of process equipment.</li>
<li><strong>Power:</strong> Heat exchangers and other components.</li>
<li><strong>Water:</strong> Water treatment equipment.</li>
<li><strong>Paper &amp; Pulp:</strong> Process equipment for pulp and paper manufacturing.</li>
<li><strong>Aerospace:</strong> (Mentioned but not detailed)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Historically, shell &amp; tube heat exchangers have been dominant</strong>, but Anup is strategically shifting towards larger-sized equipment (reactors, vessels, columns) leveraging its new facility at Kheda, Gujarat.</p>
<p><strong>III. Risks:</strong></p>
<p>The annual report identifies several key risks:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Geopolitical Uncertainty:</strong> Global events impacting international trade and supply chains.</li>
<li><strong>Skilled Labor Shortage:</strong> Difficulty in finding and retaining skilled workers.</li>
<li><strong>Automation and Productivity Improvements:</strong>  The necessity for continuous improvement in efficiency to compete globally.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Risk Management:</strong> Anup has established a Risk Management Committee and a comprehensive Risk Management Policy.  The Internal Audit Department plays a vital role in risk identification, assessment, monitoring, mitigation, and reporting.</p>
<p><strong>IV. ESG Initiatives:</strong></p>
<p>Anup&rsquo;s Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report (BRSR) details its ESG performance and commitment.  Key initiatives:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Health, Safety &amp; Rights:</strong>  Anup adheres to best practices, seeking certifications like ISO 45001 to mitigate workplace risks and ensure a safe work environment.</li>
<li><strong>Waste Management:</strong> Anup focuses on proper handling and disposal of hazardous waste, particularly metal scrap recycling, which presents both a risk mitigation and an opportunity.</li>
<li><strong>Responsible Supply Chain:</strong> Due diligence processes are employed when selecting suppliers, emphasizing sustainability.</li>
<li><strong>Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR):</strong>  Anup spent ₹1.33 Cr on CSR projects focused on rural development (efficient irrigation, bio-char project) and education (digital learning programs).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Overall ESG Assessment:</strong> While Anup demonstrates commitment to ESG, the report lacks specific, measurable targets and quantitative data for several key areas.  The BRSR seems more descriptive than prescriptive, indicating a need for more robust reporting and implementation of goals going forward.</p>
<p><strong>V. Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>Anup Engineering Limited exhibits strong financial performance in FY2023-24, driven by revenue growth, operational efficiency, and a healthy order book.  The company is strategically diversifying its product portfolio and expanding its export footprint.  While acknowledging key risks, Anup has implemented risk management measures.  However,  the ESG reporting requires greater depth and measurable targets to provide a more complete picture of its sustainability performance.  The company&rsquo;s overall outlook seems positive, but continued focus on skilled labor, supply chain resilience, and a more comprehensive ESG strategy will be crucial for sustained growth.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a summary of Anup Engineering Limited&rsquo;s cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities for the year ended <strong>March 31, 2024</strong>, in Indian Rupees (₹) in Lakhs, as reported in the Statement of Cash Flows:</p>
<ul>

</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cash Flow from Investing Activities:</strong> ₹(15,252.34) Lakhs (A cash outflow of ₹1,525.23 million). This reflects the cash used in investing activities, primarily capital expenditures (purchase of property, plant, and equipment) and investments in securities.</p>

<h3 class="heading" id="cash-flow-metrics">

</h3>
<p>To calculate free cash flow (FCF), we need to make some assumptions based on the information provided in the annual report since a direct FCF figure isn&rsquo;t explicitly stated.  We will use the figures already extracted.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Capital Expenditure (CAPEX):</strong> ₹4,291.18 Lakhs (₹429.12 million). This is calculated from the cash flow statement as the &ldquo;Purchase of Property, Plant &amp; Equipment (including Capital advances)&rdquo;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dividends Paid:</strong> ₹1,466.75 Lakhs (₹146.68 million). This is explicitly stated in the cash flow statement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Free Cash Flow (FCF):</strong>  To estimate FCF, we&rsquo;ll use the common formula:  FCF = Operating Cash Flow - CAPEX.</p>
<p>Using the values extracted from the statement of cash flows:
FCF ≈ ₹16,938.43 Lakhs - ₹4,291.18 Lakhs = ₹12,647.25 Lakhs  (₹1,264.73 million).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Considerations:</strong></p>

<li><strong>This FCF calculation is an approximation.</strong>  A more precise FCF calculation might include other items like changes in working capital not directly related to operations and potentially other capital expenditures.</li>

  Profitability Ratios
  <a class="anchor" href="#profitability-ratios">#</a>
</h3>
<p>To calculate the profitability ratios, we&rsquo;ll use the figures previously extracted from Anup Engineering Limited&rsquo;s financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2024.  Remember that these are calculations based on the reported figures and may differ slightly from the company&rsquo;s official reporting due to rounding or different accounting treatments.  All percentages are rounded to two decimal places.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Gross Profit Margin:</strong> (Gross Profit / Revenue) * 100 = (₹10,711.22 Lakhs / ₹55,038.45 Lakhs) * 100 = 19.46%</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Operating Profit Margin (EBIT Margin):</strong> (Operating Income / Revenue) * 100 = (₹(58.03) Lakhs / ₹55,038.45 Lakhs) * 100 = -0.11%  This is a loss. Note that this calculation uses EBIT.  The MD&amp;A reports a different operating margin (21.5%) presumably using a different calculation, possibly EBITDA or including some adjustments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Net Profit Margin:</strong> (Net Income / Revenue) * 100 = (₹10,347.50 Lakhs / ₹55,038.45 Lakhs) * 100 = 18.80%</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Return on Equity (ROE):</strong> (Net Income / Average Shareholders&rsquo; Equity) * 100  To calculate the average shareholders&rsquo; equity, we would need the shareholders&rsquo; equity for the beginning of the fiscal year (not provided).  Therefore, this ratio cannot be accurately calculated here.  However, the MD&amp;A provides the ROE, which was 19.58% for FY 2023-24</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Return on Assets (ROA):</strong> (Net Income / Average Total Assets) * 100. Similar to ROE, we require the total assets for the beginning of the fiscal year to compute the average, which is not available. Therefore, this ratio cannot be calculated from the provided information.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Note:</strong>  These calculations are based on information extracted from the provided report.  Always cross-reference with the company&rsquo;s official financial statements for the most accurate results.  Discrepancies might be due to rounding differences or to different accounting treatments between the provided extracts and the official report.  The MD&amp;A provides certain ratios which may differ from those we calculated based on the extracts.</p>

  Liquidity Ratios
  <a class="anchor" href="#liquidity-ratios">#</a>
</h3>
<p>To calculate the liquidity ratios for Anup Engineering Limited as of March 31, 2024, we&rsquo;ll use the previously extracted figures. Remember that these are calculations based on the reported numbers and might vary slightly from the company&rsquo;s official reporting due to rounding or slightly different accounting treatments.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Current Ratio:</strong> (Current Assets / Current Liabilities) = ₹46,477.48 Lakhs / ₹25,050.52 Lakhs = 1.86</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Quick Ratio (Acid-Test Ratio):</strong> (Current Assets - Inventories) / Current Liabilities = (₹46,477.48 Lakhs - ₹16,528.45 Lakhs) / ₹25,050.52 Lakhs = 1.19</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cash Ratio:</strong> (Cash and Cash Equivalents / Current Liabilities) = ₹1,774.75 Lakhs / ₹25,050.52 Lakhs = 0.07</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Note:</strong> These calculations rely on the data extracted from the provided annual report.  Always consult the official financial statements for the most accurate figures, as slight variations might occur due to rounding or different accounting treatments.</p>
<h3 class="heading" id="efficiency-ratios">
  Efficiency Ratios
  <a class="anchor" href="#efficiency-ratios">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Calculating Anup Engineering Limited&rsquo;s efficiency ratios requires using the figures previously extracted from the annual report and making some assumptions since not all necessary data points are explicitly given.  The results will be approximations, and the official annual report should be consulted for the most accurate figures.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Asset Turnover:</strong> (Revenue / Average Total Assets).  We need the total assets at the beginning of the fiscal year to calculate the average, which is not provided. Therefore, this ratio cannot be precisely calculated here.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Inventory Turnover:</strong> (Cost of Revenue / Average Inventory). Similar to asset turnover, we need the beginning inventory value to calculate the average.  This data point is unavailable, therefore a precise calculation is not possible. The MD&amp;A provides an inventory turnover ratio of 3.77 for FY 2023-24.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Receivables Turnover:</strong> (Revenue / Average Accounts Receivable). Again, we need the beginning accounts receivable balance to determine the average. Without this, an exact calculation is not possible. The MD&amp;A reports a receivables turnover ratio of 3.99 for FY 2023-24.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>In summary:</strong> While we can&rsquo;t calculate the precise asset turnover ratio with the available data,  the MD&amp;A provides the inventory and receivables turnover, which were 3.77 and 3.99 times, respectively, for FY 2023-24.  Remember that these are the company&rsquo;s reported figures which may have slight differences due to rounding or other reporting standards.</p>

  Leverage Ratios
  <a class="anchor" href="#leverage-ratios">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Let&rsquo;s calculate Anup Engineering Limited&rsquo;s leverage ratios as of March 31, 2024, using the figures previously extracted.  Remember that these are approximations; the official annual report should be consulted for the most precise figures.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Debt-to-Equity Ratio:</strong> (Total Debt / Shareholders&rsquo; Equity).  Total debt includes both current and non-current liabilities of a debt nature, which sums to ₹3,306.30 Lakhs (₹1,927.36 Lakhs + ₹1,379.00 Lakhs).</p>
<p>Debt-to-Equity Ratio = ₹3,306.30 Lakhs / ₹52,844.64 Lakhs = 0.06</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Debt-to-Assets Ratio:</strong> (Total Debt / Total Assets) = ₹3,306.30 Lakhs / ₹80,843.08 Lakhs = 0.04</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Interest Coverage Ratio:</strong> (Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT) / Interest Expense) =  To calculate EBIT, we need to add back interest expense to the operating income (EBIT).  Operating income (EBIT) was a loss of ₹(58.03) Lakhs. The interest expense was ₹217.44 Lakhs.</p>
<p>Interest Coverage Ratio = ₹(58.03 + 217.44) Lakhs / ₹217.44 Lakhs = 0.73. This represents that the EBIT was not sufficient to cover the interest expense.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Note:</strong> These calculations are based on the data extracted and might differ slightly from the company&rsquo;s official reporting due to rounding or different accounting treatments. The official annual report should always be consulted for the most accurate results.  The MD&amp;A presents some key ratios which may differ from our calculations based on the data extracts.</p>

<p>Calculating these market-based ratios requires information not directly provided in the annual report.  We need the current market price per share and the number of outstanding shares at the end of the fiscal year. The annual report provides information on the number of outstanding shares but not the market price.  Therefore, precise calculations cannot be performed.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Market Cap:</strong> (Current Market Price per Share * Number of Outstanding Shares).  This cannot be calculated without the current market price.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Price-to-Earnings Ratio (PE Ratio):</strong> (Current Market Price per Share / Earnings Per Share).  This needs both the market price and the EPS, neither of which is current in the document.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Price-to-Book Ratio (PB Ratio):</strong> (Current Market Price per Share / Book Value per Share).  This calculation requires the current market price per share and the book value per share (shareholders&rsquo; equity/number of outstanding shares).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dividend Yield:</strong> (Annual Dividend per Share / Current Market Price per Share) * 100.  This needs the current market price and the annual dividend per share (which is a proposed dividend subject to shareholder approval).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dividend Payout Ratio:</strong> (Dividends Paid / Net Income) * 100. We know the dividends paid (₹1,466.75 Lakhs). We also have net income (₹10,347.50 Lakhs). Therefore, we can approximate this: (₹1,466.75 Lakhs / ₹10,347.50 Lakhs) * 100 ≈ 14.17%.  However, this is based on the <em>paid</em> dividend, not the <em>proposed</em> dividend.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>In summary:</strong>  Only the dividend payout ratio could be approximated using the information provided in the annual report.  To calculate the market cap, PE ratio, PB ratio, and the dividend yield, you would need to obtain the current market price of Anup&rsquo;s shares from a financial website or data provider.  The values presented here should not be considered definitive.</p>

<p>The provided annual report does <em>not</em> include ESG ratings from any external rating agencies.  The report contains a Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report (BRSR), which details Anup&rsquo;s ESG initiatives and performance, but it does not include scores or ratings from organizations such as MSCI, Sustainalytics, Refinitiv, etc.  To find ESG ratings for Anup Engineering Limited, you would need to consult independent ESG rating agencies directly or through financial data providers.</p>
<h3 class="heading" id="esg-initiatives">
  ESG Initiatives
  <a class="anchor" href="#esg-initiatives">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Anup Engineering Limited&rsquo;s annual report, specifically the Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report (BRSR), outlines several environmental, social, and governance (ESG) initiatives. However, the level of detail and quantification varies across different areas.  Here&rsquo;s a summary based on the provided information:</p>
<p><strong>I. Environmental Initiatives:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Energy Conservation:</strong> Anup aims to minimize energy consumption through continuous monitoring, improved maintenance, and optimized operational techniques. The company has installed a Windmill (750 KW) and a solar plant (990 KW) to utilize renewable energy sources.  Specific energy reduction targets are not stated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Water Management:</strong>  The company reports water withdrawal and consumption but lacks specific targets or goals for water efficiency. It highlights the use of a Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) plant to minimize water discharge.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Waste Management:</strong> Anup focuses on metal scrap recycling.  While specific recycling rates aren&rsquo;t provided, the BRSR emphasizes reducing waste generation and using environmentally friendly disposal methods.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions:</strong> The BRSR reports Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions (1459 and 4912 metric tonnes of CO2 equivalent respectively) and intensity but doesn&rsquo;t include Scope 3 emissions or set reduction targets.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>II. Carbon Footprint:</strong></p>
<p>Anup&rsquo;s  carbon footprint is partially disclosed through its Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions data.  However, the report lacks Scope 3 emissions data, making a complete assessment of its carbon footprint impossible. No specific reduction targets or goals are mentioned.</p>
<p><strong>III. Social Initiatives:</strong></p>
<p>Anup&rsquo;s social initiatives primarily fall under its Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) program. Key projects include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rural Development:</strong>  Promoting efficient irrigation systems and a bio-char project to improve agricultural practices in Botad and Sabarkatha districts.</li>
<li><strong>Education:</strong>  Providing digital learning programs to government school students, aiming to improve their basic digital literacy skills.</li>
</ul>
<p>While the report describes these initiatives, it doesn&rsquo;t provide specific social impact metrics or targets beyond the number of people impacted.</p>
<p><strong>IV. Governance Practices:</strong></p>
<p>The  annual report  details  Anup&rsquo;s  governance structure, including the composition of the Board of Directors, its committees (Audit, Nomination &amp; Remuneration, Stakeholders&rsquo; Relationship, CSR, Risk Management), and their activities.  The report emphasizes compliance with the Companies Act, 2013, and SEBI regulations.  It includes a whistleblower policy and affirms compliance with the code of conduct for directors and senior management.</p>
<p><strong>V. Sustainability Goals:</strong></p>
<p>Anup&rsquo;s  annual report doesn&rsquo;t explicitly state long-term, quantified sustainability goals.  While it highlights several environmental and social initiatives, it lacks specific targets for emissions reduction, resource efficiency, or social impact measurements.  This is a significant weakness in the report, hindering a robust assessment of Anup&rsquo;s commitment to long-term sustainability.</p>
<p><strong>Overall Assessment:</strong>  Anup&rsquo;s annual report demonstrates some commitment to ESG principles. However, the lack of specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) sustainability goals and the limited quantitative data significantly hampers a complete assessment of its sustainability performance and progress.  More robust and comprehensive reporting with specific targets and measurable indicators is necessary for improved transparency and accountability.</p>
