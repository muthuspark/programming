<p>The Colgate-Palmolive (India) Limited Annual Report doesn&rsquo;t explicitly separate &ldquo;Cost of Revenue&rdquo; as a distinct line item in the way some reports do.  Instead, it presents &ldquo;Cost of Materials Consumed,&rdquo; &ldquo;Purchases of Stock-in-Trade,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Changes in Inventories&rdquo; which, when combined, represent the cost of goods sold.  Therefore, we will use this combination as a proxy for &ldquo;Cost of Revenue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the breakdown of the relevant financial figures for the year ended March 31, 2024 (in Indian Rupees, in lakhs):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Revenue:</strong> ₹568,042.84 Lakhs (₹522,619.71 Lakhs in FY2022-23)</li>
<li><strong>Cost of Revenue (Proxy):</strong> ₹172,268.36 Lakhs (₹179,021.43 Lakhs in FY2022-23).  This is calculated as: Cost of Materials Consumed (₹145,758.73 Lakhs) + Purchases of Stock-in-Trade (₹24,491.33 Lakhs) + Change in Inventories (₹2,018.26 Lakhs).</li>
<li><strong>Gross Profit:</strong> ₹395,774.48 Lakhs (₹343,598.28 Lakhs in FY2022-23). This is calculated as: Revenue - Cost of Revenue.</li>
<li><strong>Operating Expenses:</strong> ₹215,632.32 Lakhs (₹243,509.00 Lakhs in FY2022-23). This encompasses Employee Benefits Expense, Finance Costs, Depreciation and Amortization Expense, and Other Expenses.</li>
<li><strong>Operating Income:</strong> ₹180,142.16 Lakhs (₹100,089.28 Lakhs in FY2022-23). This is calculated as: Gross Profit - Operating Expenses.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Note:</strong> These figures are in lakhs (1 lakh = 100,000). Multiply each number by 100,000 to get the values in Rupees.  Also, remember that the &ldquo;Cost of Revenue&rdquo; figure is a proxy calculation based on the information available in the report.  A true &ldquo;Cost of Revenue&rdquo; might include slightly different components.</p>

<p>Here are the Net Income, EBITDA, Basic EPS, and Diluted EPS values for Colgate-Palmolive (India) Limited for the year ended March 31, 2024, extracted from the financial statements (in Indian Rupees, in lakhs):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Net Income:</strong> ₹132,365.96 Lakhs (₹104,714.65 Lakhs in FY2022-23)</li>
<li><strong>EBITDA:</strong>  The report does not explicitly state EBITDA.  It would need to be calculated using the information provided.  Using the figures we&rsquo;ve already established, a <em>proxy</em> calculation for EBITDA would be: Operating Income (₹180,142.16 Lakhs) + Depreciation and Amortization (₹17,151.05 Lakhs) = ₹197,293.21 Lakhs (A precise EBITDA figure would require a more detailed income statement).</li>
<li><strong>Basic EPS:</strong> ₹48.67 (₹38.50 in FY2022-23)</li>
<li><strong>Diluted EPS:</strong> ₹48.67 (₹38.50 in FY2022-23)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Note:</strong>  These figures are in lakhs (1 lakh = 100,000).  Multiply each number by 100,000 to obtain the values in Rupees.  The EBITDA figure provided is a <em>proxy</em> calculation and may differ slightly from the company&rsquo;s internally calculated value due to possible differences in how certain items are categorized on their internal statements.</p>

<p>The Colgate-Palmolive (India) Annual Report doesn&rsquo;t directly provide a &ldquo;Free Cash Flow&rdquo; figure.  Free cash flow is a calculated metric, not a standard line item on the cash flow statement.  To calculate a proxy for free cash flow, we need to make some assumptions.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what we can extract directly from the report and a calculation for a <em>proxy</em> free cash flow:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Capital Expenditure (CAPEX):</strong> ₹7,556.40 Lakhs (₹7,008.94 Lakhs in FY2022-23).  This is the cash outflow for the purchase of property, plant, and equipment (Note that proceeds from disposals are already netted out in the investing cash flow figure provided earlier).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dividends Paid:</strong> ₹116,702.57 Lakhs (₹105,745.18 Lakhs in FY2022-23). This is directly from the statement of cash flows.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Proxy Free Cash Flow Calculation:</strong>  A common calculation for free cash flow is:  Operating Cash Flow - Capital Expenditures.  Using the figures we&rsquo;ve previously established:</p>
<p>₹119,896.38 Lakhs (Operating Cash Flow) - ₹7,556.40 Lakhs (CAPEX) = ₹112,339.98 Lakhs (Proxy Free Cash Flow)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Considerations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Proxy Nature:</strong> The free cash flow calculated above is a <em>proxy</em> and might not perfectly align with the company&rsquo;s internal calculation. The company&rsquo;s actual free cash flow calculation might include other items (e.g., changes in working capital, debt repayments, etc.)  not explicitly detailed in the statement of cash flows.</li>
<li><strong>Units:</strong>  All figures are in lakhs (1 lakh = 100,000). Multiply each number by 100,000 to get the values in Rupees.</li>

<p>To calculate these profitability ratios for Colgate-Palmolive (India) Limited for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2024, we&rsquo;ll use the figures we&rsquo;ve previously derived from the financial statements. Remember that some of these figures (particularly Cost of Revenue and EBITDA) are <em>proxy</em> calculations based on the available data and might slightly differ from the company&rsquo;s precise internal calculations.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Gross Margin:</strong> (Gross Profit / Revenue) * 100</p>
<ul>
<li>₹395,774.48 Lakhs (Gross Profit) / ₹568,042.84 Lakhs (Revenue) * 100 = 69.7%</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Operating Margin:</strong> (Operating Income / Revenue) * 100</p>
<ul>
<li>₹180,142.16 Lakhs (Operating Income) / ₹568,042.84 Lakhs (Revenue) * 100 = 31.7%</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Net Profit Margin:</strong> (Net Income / Revenue) * 100</p>
<ul>
<li>₹132,365.96 Lakhs (Net Income) / ₹568,042.84 Lakhs (Revenue) * 100 = 23.3%</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Return on Equity (ROE):</strong> (Net Income / Average Shareholders&rsquo; Equity) * 100.  To calculate average shareholders&rsquo; equity, we&rsquo;ll use the beginning and ending balances from the balance sheet:</p>
<ul>
<li>Average Shareholders&rsquo; Equity: (₹171,638.43 Lakhs + ₹187,436.16 Lakhs) / 2 = ₹179,537.30 Lakhs</li>
<li>ROE: ₹132,365.96 Lakhs / ₹179,537.30 Lakhs * 100 = 73.7%</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Return on Assets (ROA):</strong> (Net Income / Average Total Assets) * 100.  Similarly, we&rsquo;ll calculate average total assets:</p>
<ul>
<li>Average Total Assets: (₹288,298.93 Lakhs + ₹319,652.77 Lakhs) / 2 = ₹303,975.85 Lakhs</li>
<li>ROA: ₹132,365.96 Lakhs / ₹303,975.85 Lakhs * 100 = 43.5%</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Note:</strong>  All figures are in lakhs (1 lakh = 100,000).  These are calculated using the <em>proxy</em> figures previously determined.  The company&rsquo;s internally calculated figures might show minor variations depending on their exact accounting methodologies.  The percentage changes are approximations based on the rounded-off numbers presented in the report.</p>

</h3>
<p>To calculate these liquidity ratios for Colgate-Palmolive (India) Limited for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2024, we&rsquo;ll use the figures previously derived from the financial statements. Remember that these are <em>proxy</em> calculations, and slight variations might exist compared to the company&rsquo;s precise internal computations because of rounding and the method of calculating certain components.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Current Ratio:</strong> (Current Assets / Current Liabilities)</p>
<ul>
<li>₹190,381.11 Lakhs (Current Assets) / ₹123,934.52 Lakhs (Current Liabilities) = 1.54</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Quick Ratio:</strong> (Current Assets - Inventories) / Current Liabilities. This ratio is a more stringent measure of liquidity, excluding inventories which might not be easily convertible to cash:</p>
<ul>
<li>(₹190,381.11 Lakhs - ₹29,641.37 Lakhs) / ₹123,934.52 Lakhs = 1.30</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cash Ratio:</strong> (Cash and Cash Equivalents / Current Liabilities). This is the most conservative liquidity ratio, considering only the most liquid assets:</p>
<ul>
<li>₹88,899.34 Lakhs (Cash and Cash Equivalents) / ₹123,934.52 Lakhs (Current Liabilities) = 0.72</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Note:</strong> All figures are in lakhs (1 lakh = 100,000).  These calculations are based on the <em>proxy</em> values previously determined and may vary slightly from the company&rsquo;s internally calculated figures due to their accounting practices and the rounding of the numbers presented in the report.</p>

<p>To calculate these efficiency ratios for Colgate-Palmolive (India) Limited for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2024, we will utilize the figures previously derived from the financial statements.  Recall that these calculations are <em>proxies</em>, and minor differences from the company&rsquo;s precise internal figures are possible due to variations in accounting practices and the rounding of numbers in the report.  We will also need to calculate average balances for inventory and receivables.</p>

<p><strong>Asset Turnover:</strong> (Revenue / Average Total Assets)</p>
<ul>
<li>Average Total Assets: (₹288,298.93 Lakhs + ₹319,652.77 Lakhs) / 2 = ₹303,975.85 Lakhs</li>
<li>Asset Turnover: ₹568,042.84 Lakhs (Revenue) / ₹303,975.85 Lakhs = 1.87</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Inventory Turnover:</strong> (Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory)</p>
<ul>
<li>Average Inventory: (₹33,544.96 Lakhs + ₹29,641.37 Lakhs) / 2 = ₹31,593.17 Lakhs  (Using the figures for beginning and ending inventory)</li>
<li>Cost of Goods Sold (Proxy): ₹172,268.36 Lakhs (as previously calculated)</li>
<li>Inventory Turnover: ₹172,268.36 Lakhs / ₹31,593.17 Lakhs = 5.45</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Receivables Turnover:</strong> (Revenue / Average Accounts Receivable)</p>
<ul>
<li>Average Accounts Receivable: (₹15,736.61 Lakhs + ₹16,738.93 Lakhs) / 2 = ₹16,237.77 Lakhs</li>
<li>Receivables Turnover: ₹568,042.84 Lakhs (Revenue) / ₹16,237.77 Lakhs = 35.0</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Note:</strong>  All figures are in lakhs (1 lakh = 100,000).  These are <em>proxy</em> calculations.  The company&rsquo;s precise internal figures may show slight differences due to their accounting methods and the rounding of numbers presented in the report.</p>

Remember that these are <em>proxy</em> calculations, and minor discrepancies might occur compared to the company&rsquo;s precise internal computations due to rounding and the methods used for calculating certain components.  We&rsquo;ll also need to calculate average equity and assets.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Debt-to-Equity Ratio:</strong> (Total Debt / Total Shareholders&rsquo; Equity)</p>
<ul>
<li>Total Debt:  This requires summing up all liabilities, which is ₹132,216.61 Lakhs (as previously calculated)</li>

<p><strong>Interest Coverage Ratio:</strong> (Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT) / Interest Expense)</p>
<ul>
<li>EBIT (Proxy): We&rsquo;ll use a proxy calculation for EBIT:  Profit Before Tax (₹178,132.52 Lakhs) + Interest Expense (₹499.63 Lakhs) = ₹178,632.15 Lakhs</li>
<li>Interest Expense: ₹499.63 Lakhs</li>
<li>Interest Coverage Ratio: ₹178,632.15 Lakhs / ₹499.63 Lakhs = 357.5</li>

<p>To calculate these market-related ratios for Colgate-Palmolive (India) Limited, we need information not directly provided in the annual report itself: the current market price per share and the number of outstanding shares.  The annual report provides the <em>number</em> of outstanding shares but not a current market price.  Therefore, we cannot provide precise values for these ratios.  To obtain these figures you would need to consult a live financial data source such as a financial news website or database which tracks market data for listed companies.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what we <em>can</em> say about how these ratios would be calculated once you obtain the necessary market data:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Market Capitalization (Market Cap):</strong>  Market Price per Share * Number of Outstanding Shares</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Price-to-Earnings Ratio (PE Ratio):</strong> Market Price per Share / Earnings Per Share (EPS).  The annual report provides the EPS.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Price-to-Book Ratio (PB Ratio):</strong> Market Price per Share / Book Value per Share.  The book value per share is calculated by dividing the shareholders&rsquo; equity by the number of outstanding shares. The annual report provides the shareholders&rsquo; equity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dividend Yield:</strong> (Annual Dividend per Share / Market Price per Share) * 100. The annual report provides the annual dividend per share.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dividend Payout Ratio:</strong> (Total Dividends Paid / Net Income) * 100. The annual report provides both total dividends paid and net income.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you obtain the current market price per share from a reliable financial source, you can substitute that value (along with the values provided in the annual report) into the above formulas to calculate these market-related ratios.</p>

  Segment Analysis
  <a class="anchor" href="#segment-analysis">#</a>
</h3>
<p>The Colgate-Palmolive (India) Limited annual report doesn&rsquo;t provide a detailed segment breakdown with precise revenue figures, growth rates, and market shares for each sub-segment within Oral Care or Personal Care.  The report primarily focuses on the overall company performance and highlights key product launches and marketing campaigns. Therefore, a complete response to your request isn&rsquo;t possible using only the provided annual report data.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a summary of the information available regarding the business segments:</p>
<p><strong>I. Business Segments:</strong></p>
<p>The report primarily identifies two broad business segments:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Oral Care:</strong> This is the core and dominant business segment, comprising toothpastes, toothbrushes, and mouthwashes.  The report does not break this segment down further into specific product categories (e.g., different toothpaste types).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Personal Care:</strong> This segment includes the Palmolive brand, primarily offering body washes.  Again, a further breakdown into specific product lines isn&rsquo;t given.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>II. Data Limitations:</strong></p>
<p>The annual report does <em>not</em> provide the following data points requested, making a precise analysis of individual segment performance impossible:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Segment-Specific Revenues:</strong>  The report only provides the total revenue for the entire company.</li>
<li><strong>Growth Rates:</strong> The report mentions overall revenue growth, but not separate growth rates for each segment.</li>
<li><strong>Operating Margins:</strong>  Operating margin is given for the company as a whole but not broken down by segment.</li>
<li><strong>Market Shares:</strong>  The report states Colgate&rsquo;s leading market position in toothpaste and toothbrushes but doesn&rsquo;t quantify market share percentages for specific product categories or segments.</li>
<li><strong>Geographic Presence (within India):</strong> While the report mentions nationwide reach, a specific state-wise or regional breakdown isn&rsquo;t available for each segment.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>III. Key Products (by Segment):</strong></p>
<p>The information available allows us to list some of the key products within each segment:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Oral Care:</strong>  Colgate Strong Teeth, Colgate MaxFresh, Colgate Active Salt, Colgate Total, Colgate Visible White O2, Colgate Total Sensitive, Zig Zag toothbrushes, Colgate Super Junior toothbrushes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Personal Care:</strong> Palmolive body washes (with many new variants launched in FY2023-24).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>IV. Obtaining Missing Data:</strong></p>
<p>To acquire the missing data points, you would need to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Consult Secondary Sources:</strong>  Look for market research reports from firms like Nielsen or Euromonitor that provide detailed data on the Indian oral care and personal care markets.</li>
<li><strong>Company Investor Relations:</strong> Check Colgate-Palmolive (India)&rsquo;s investor relations website; more granular segment information might be disclosed in presentations or supplementary documents.</li>
</ul>
<p>In short, while the annual report gives an overview of the company&rsquo;s overall performance and highlights key product lines, it lacks the detailed segment-level data needed for a thorough comparative analysis.  You&rsquo;ll need to supplement the annual report with external market research.</p>
