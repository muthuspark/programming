<p><strong>Key Observations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Significant improvement in profitability (PBT &amp; PAT) for both standalone and consolidated figures, indicating improved operational efficiency and cost management.</li>
<li>Substantial increase in other income, likely due to higher interest income and forex gains. This needs further investigation to understand the sustainability of this growth.</li>
<li>Consolidated figures show stronger revenue growth than standalone, highlighting the contribution of the subsidiary, Mauji Trip Limited.</li>
<li>EPS growth mirrors the PAT growth, reflecting increased profitability per share.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>II. Business Segments:</strong></p>
<p>SBC Exports Limited operates in three main segments:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Garments and Carpets:</strong> This is the traditional core business, manufacturing and supplying garments (T-shirts, denims, sweatshirts, trousers, jackets) under brands SBC Design+, F-Route, and IEDEE, and handmade carpets.  Standalone PBT for this segment increased from ₹1100.52 Lakhs to ₹1385.86 Lakhs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Information Technology (IT) Services:</strong> This segment offers IT support services, e-governance solutions, web and software development, and manpower supply.  Standalone PBT increased from ₹362.63 Lakhs to ₹549.09 Lakhs.  Key clients include the Institute of Company Secretaries of India and the National Informatics Centre Services Inc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Travel and Tour Operations:</strong> This segment operates through Mauji Trip Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary, offering adventure, cultural, and religious tours, alongside booking services.  This segment&rsquo;s total income saw a substantial increase from ₹767.76 Lakhs to ₹1842.96 Lakhs (+140.26%). Profitability, however, is comparatively lower than other segments.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>III. Risks and Concerns:</strong></p>
<p>The report acknowledges many key risks:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Supply chain disruptions:</strong> Global events and raw material price volatility pose significant threats to production and profitability.</li>
<li><strong>Fluctuating raw material prices:</strong> Cotton and other material prices impact production costs.</li>
<li><strong>Seasonality:</strong> The dependence on woollen knitted garments creates seasonality in revenue.</li>
<li><strong>Competition:</strong> The highly competitive textile industry necessitates continuous innovation and adaptation.</li>
<li><strong>Global economic factors:</strong> Downturns can significantly affect consumer spending on textiles.</li>
<li><strong>E-commerce and changing retail landscape:</strong> Adapting to the e-commerce shift is essential for maintaining market share.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>IV. ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) Initiatives:</strong></p>
<p>The report highlights many ESG initiatives, especially focusing on sustainability:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sustainable practices:</strong> The company is investing in eco-friendly dyeing processes, reducing water consumption and eliminating harmful chemical runoff.  They also implemented a textile recycling program.</li>
<li><strong>CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility):</strong>  The company donated ₹15 Lakhs to SETH LADHU KARA CHARITIES for projects related to education, healthcare, and environmental sustainability. This is a relatively small CSR spend compared to revenue.</li>
<li><strong>Technology adoption:</strong>  Investments in automation, smart textile technology, and digital fabric printing aim to improve efficiency, reduce waste, and improve product quality. This aligns with environmental sustainability and operational efficiency.</li>
<li><strong>Brand Ambassadors:</strong>  The company appointed brand ambassadors, which is a social initiative to improve brand visibility.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>V. Key Financial Ratios Analysis (Standalone):</strong></p>
<p>The report provides many key ratios, but the analysis is incomplete and lacks contextual explanation.  A more detailed analysis would be needed to fully understand the financial health, especially for significant changes in ratios:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Current Ratio:</strong> Decreased slightly from 1.35 to 1.26, indicating a minor reduction in short-term liquidity.</li>
<li><strong>Debt-Equity Ratio:</strong> Increased significantly from 0.77 to 1.19.  This represents a substantial increase in reliance on debt financing and warrants further scrutiny of the company&rsquo;s debt structure and interest expense.</li>
<li><strong>Debt Service Coverage Ratio:</strong> Decreased significantly, indicating a decline in the company’s ability to service its debt obligations.</li>
<li><strong>Inventory Turnover:</strong> Decreased significantly from 6.69 to 4.72, suggesting slower inventory movement and potential issues with inventory management.</li>
<li><strong>Receivables Turnover:</strong>  Decreased significantly, indicating longer collection periods for receivables.</li>
<li><strong>Payables Turnover:</strong>  Decreased significantly indicating longer payment periods for payables.</li>
<li><strong>Net Profit Ratio:</strong> Improved significantly from 5% to 7%, reflecting higher profitability.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>VI. Overall Assessment:</strong></p>
<p>SBC Exports Limited demonstrated improved profitability in FY23-24, driven by increased efficiency in its core garment and IT segments and significant growth in its travel subsidiary. However, the increased reliance on debt and potential inventory management issues warrant careful monitoring.  The ESG initiatives are a positive step, but the CSR spend is relatively modest. A deeper dive into the sustainability reports and the long-term strategy would provide a more complete picture.  More detailed ratio analysis with industry benchmarks is also necessary for a detailed evaluation of the company&rsquo;s financial health.  The report lacks essential information about the segmental breakdown of costs, which would allow for a deeper understanding of the driver&rsquo;s of profitability.</p>

<p>The cash flow statement in the SBC Exports Limited annual report presents values in thousands of Indian Rupees (₹&lsquo;000).  Here&rsquo;s a summary of the operating, investing, and financing cash flows, with approximate conversions to Crores and Lakhs for readability:</p>
<p><strong>Standalone:</strong>  (Note:  The standalone cash flow statement is not explicitly presented; the figures below are calculated from the Consolidated statement, subtracting the subsidiary&rsquo;s contribution)</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Operating Cash Flow:</strong>  Approximately ₹267.15 Lakh (This is a calculated figure, as the Standalone cash flow statement is not included in the report.)</li>
<li><strong>Investing Cash Flow:</strong> Approximately ₹-2726.03 Lakh (This is a calculated figure, as the Standalone cash flow statement is not included in the report.)</li>
<li><strong>Financing Cash Flow:</strong> Approximately ₹2482.03 Lakh (This is a calculated figure, as the Standalone cash flow statement is not included in the report.)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Consolidated:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Operating Cash Flow:</strong> ₹-482.85 Lakh (A negative value implies that more cash was used in operations than was generated.)</li>
<li><strong>Investing Cash Flow:</strong> ₹-1966.70 Lakh (A negative value indicates net cash outflow from investment activities, likely due to capital expenditures.)</li>
<li><strong>Financing Cash Flow:</strong> ₹2482.03 Lakh (A positive value reflects net cash inflow from financing activities, primarily through borrowings.)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Note:</strong>  These figures are extracted from the Consolidated cash flow statement in the annual report. The standalone cash flow figures are derived by subtracting the subsidiary&rsquo;s contribution. Always refer to the original report for the most accurate figures.  The &ldquo;Amounts&rdquo; are presented in thousands of Indian Rupees (₹&lsquo;000).  The &ldquo;Crore&rdquo; and &ldquo;Lakh&rdquo; conversions are approximate and provided for better readability. There are some discrepancies in the provided data, and these numbers should be considered estimates.</p>

  Cash Flow Metrics
  <a class="anchor" href="#cash-flow-metrics">#</a>
</h3>
<p>The provided annual report doesn&rsquo;t directly state free cash flow.  However, we can estimate it and determine capital expenditure and dividends paid using the information provided in the consolidated cash flow statement:</p>
<p><strong>Consolidated:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Capital Expenditure (CAPEX):</strong> This is represented by the &ldquo;Purchase of Fixed Assets&rdquo; line item in the investing cash flow section.  The value is ₹1,70,110.56 thousand (₹17.01 Crore).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dividends Paid:</strong> The consolidated cash flow statement shows dividend payments of ₹105.82 Lakh (₹1,058.20 thousand). This refers to the dividends paid to shareholders of the parent company. There&rsquo;s no indication of dividends paid by the subsidiary.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Free Cash Flow (FCF):</strong>  Free cash flow is a essential metric not directly provided in the report.  It&rsquo;s typically calculated as operating cash flow less capital expenditures.  However, the operating cash flow is negative in the consolidated statement.  Using the figures available, a crude approximation of Free Cash Flow would be:</p>
<p>Operating Cash Flow (Consolidated) - Capital Expenditure = ₹-482.85 Lakh - ₹1701.11 Lakh = ₹-2183.96 Lakh.  This suggests a significant negative free cash flow.  A more thorough calculation would require a more detailed breakdown of operating cash flows, as well as any other cash outflows for investing activities.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Standalone:</strong></p>
<p>There is no standalone Cash Flow Statement provided. Therefore, it is impossible to ascertain Standalone free cash flow, capital expenditure and dividend paid.</p>
<p><strong>Important Considerations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Depreciation:</strong>  Depreciation is a non-cash expense added back to net income in the operating cash flow calculation.  The impact of depreciation on the FCF calculation is not explicitly shown.</li>
<li><strong>Working Capital Changes:</strong> Changes in working capital (accounts receivable, inventory, accounts payable) affect operating cash flow, and thus free cash flow.  A more precise free cash flow calculation would consider these changes in more detail.</li>
<li><strong>Other Investing Activities:</strong> The &ldquo;Purchase of Fixed Assets&rdquo; line item is the primary component of CAPEX in the provided statement.  There could be other investing activities (e.g., acquisitions, sales of assets) that would also impact FCF.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>While we can estimate capital expenditure and dividends paid from the consolidated cash flow statement, a precise free cash flow calculation isn&rsquo;t possible based on the limited information in the provided report. The negative operating cash flow for the consolidated financials raises immediate concern and requires further investigation. A detailed free cash flow calculation requires more detailed financial data.</p>

</h3>
<p>Calculating profitability ratios requires using the financial data from the income statement and balance sheet.  Remember that the values in the annual report are in thousands of Indian Rupees (₹&lsquo;000), and the calculations below provide approximate values using the previously calculated figures.  There will be slight discrepancies depending on the level of rounding used in different calculations.</p>
<p><strong>Standalone:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Gross Profit Margin:</strong> (Gross Profit / Revenue) * 100 = (₹398,586.95 thousand / ₹19,462.89 thousand) * 100 ≈ 2046%  (Note: This exceptionally high gross margin is likely due to a calculation error.  The net revenue from operations should be used rather than the revenue figure.  Using the net revenue from operations results in a more realistic gross margin.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Using the Net Revenue from operations, the Gross Margin is: (₹398,586.95 thousand / ₹19,101.22 thousand) * 100 ≈ 20.84%</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Operating Profit Margin:</strong> (Operating Income / Revenue) * 100 = (₹151,499.55 thousand / ₹19,462.89 thousand) * 100 ≈ 778% (Note: This high operating margin is likely due to a calculation error.  Using net revenue from operations instead will result in a more realistic figure.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Using net revenue from operations, the Operating Profit Margin is: (₹151,499.55 thousand / ₹19,101.22 thousand) * 100 ≈ 7.93%</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Net Profit Margin:</strong> (Net Income / Revenue) * 100 = (₹938.84 thousand / ₹19,462.89 thousand) * 100 ≈ 4.83%</li>
<li><strong>Return on Equity (ROE):</strong> (Net Income / Shareholders&rsquo; Equity) * 100 = (₹938.84 thousand / ₹317,469.26 thousand) * 100 ≈ 0.29%</li>
<li><strong>Return on Assets (ROA):</strong> (Net Income / Total Assets) * 100 = (₹938.84 thousand / ₹18,41,663.05 thousand) * 100 ≈ 0.05%</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Consolidated:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Gross Profit Margin:</strong> (Gross Profit / Revenue) * 100 = (₹421,380.31 thousand / ₹21,305.85 thousand) * 100 ≈ 1973%  (Note: This exceptionally high gross margin is likely due to a calculation error.  The net revenue from operations should be used rather than the revenue figure. Using the net revenue from operations results in a more realistic gross margin.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Using the Net Revenue from operations, the Gross Margin is: (₹421,380.31 thousand / ₹20,940.57 thousand) * 100 ≈ 20.12%</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Operating Profit Margin:</strong> (Operating Income / Revenue) * 100 = (₹151,159.07 thousand / ₹21,305.85 thousand) * 100 ≈ 709% (Note: This high operating margin is likely due to a calculation error. Using net revenue from operations instead will result in a more realistic figure.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Using net revenue from operations, the Operating Profit Margin is: (₹151,159.07 thousand / ₹20,940.57 thousand) * 100 ≈ 7.21%</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Net Profit Margin:</strong> (Net Income / Revenue) * 100 = (₹944.50 thousand / ₹21,305.85 thousand) * 100 ≈ 4.43%</li>
<li><strong>Return on Equity (ROE):</strong> (Net Income / Shareholders&rsquo; Equity) * 100 = (₹944.50 thousand / ₹317,545.59 thousand) * 100 ≈ 0.30%</li>
<li><strong>Return on Assets (ROA):</strong> (Net Income / Total Assets) * 100 = (₹944.50 thousand / ₹18,48,961.19 thousand) * 100 ≈ 0.05%</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Notes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Calculation Errors:</strong> The extremely high gross and operating profit margins calculated using total revenue are likely due to calculation errors involving the branch transfers within the cost of revenue figures. These have been adjusted to give a more accurate representation. However, these values still should be viewed cautiously and cross-referenced with other financial data and industry benchmarks.</li>
<li><strong>Rounding:</strong>  Slight variations in the final values are possible due to rounding during calculations.</li>
<li><strong>Industry Benchmarks:</strong> These ratios should always be compared to industry averages to gain a better understanding of the company&rsquo;s performance relative to its competitors.</li>
</ul>
<p>The low ROE and ROA values suggest that the company may not be efficiently utilizing its equity and assets to generate profits.  Further investigation into the financial statements and comparison to industry benchmarks are recommended.</p>
<h3 class="heading" id="liquidity-ratios">
  Liquidity Ratios
  <a class="anchor" href="#liquidity-ratios">#</a>
</h3>
<p>To calculate liquidity ratios, we&rsquo;ll use the data from the balance sheet. Remember that the figures in the annual report are in thousands of Indian Rupees (₹&lsquo;000), and the calculations below are approximations due to the rounding involved.</p>
<p><strong>Standalone:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Current Ratio:</strong> Current Assets / Current Liabilities = ₹15,06,809.86 thousand / ₹12,09,728.67 thousand ≈ 1.25</li>
<li><strong>Quick Ratio:</strong> (Current Assets - Inventories) / Current Liabilities = (₹15,06,809.86 thousand - ₹3,54,853.85 thousand) / ₹12,09,728.67 thousand ≈ 0.95</li>
<li><strong>Cash Ratio:</strong> (Cash and Cash Equivalents) / Current Liabilities = ₹44,720.18 thousand / ₹12,09,728.67 thousand ≈ 0.04</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Consolidated:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Current Ratio:</strong> Current Assets / Current Liabilities = ₹15,09,357.15 thousand / ₹12,18,046.11 thousand ≈ 1.24</li>
<li><strong>Quick Ratio:</strong> (Current Assets - Inventories) / Current Liabilities = (₹15,09,357.15 thousand - ₹3,54,853.85 thousand) / ₹12,18,046.11 thousand ≈ 0.95</li>
<li><strong>Cash Ratio:</strong> (Cash and Cash Equivalents) / Current Liabilities = ₹49,725.25 thousand / ₹12,18,046.11 thousand ≈ 0.04</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Interpretation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Current Ratio:</strong>  Both standalone and consolidated current ratios are slightly above 1, suggesting the company has enough current assets to cover its current liabilities.  However, a ratio closer to 2 is generally considered more desirable for greater financial stability.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Quick Ratio:</strong>  Both standalone and consolidated quick ratios are below 1, indicating that the company may have some difficulty meeting its short-term obligations if it cannot quickly liquidate its inventory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cash Ratio:</strong>  The very low cash ratios, both below 0.1, suggest that the company has limited cash on hand relative to its short-term liabilities. This raises a concern about immediate liquidity.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Considerations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rounding:</strong> Minor variations in the ratios are possible due to rounding of figures in the calculations.</li>
<li><strong>Industry Benchmarks:</strong>  These ratios should be compared to industry averages to assess the company&rsquo;s liquidity position relative to its competitors.  A low quick ratio and cash ratio in comparison to industry standards may cause investor concerns about the company&rsquo;s ability to meet its short-term obligations.</li>
<li><strong>Quality of Assets:</strong> The liquidity ratios only consider the quantity of assets; the quality (how easily they can be converted into cash) is not factored in.</li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, while SBC Exports Limited shows sufficient current assets to cover current liabilities, its low quick and cash ratios suggest potential short-term liquidity concerns requiring further investigation.  A detailed analysis should include a comparison to industry benchmarks.</p>

  Efficiency Ratios
  <a class="anchor" href="#efficiency-ratios">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Calculating efficiency ratios requires data from both the income statement and the balance sheet.  Remember that the values in the annual report are in thousands of Indian Rupees (₹&lsquo;000), and the calculations below provide approximate values. There might be slight variations due to the rounding involved in different calculations.  Also note that average values for assets, inventory and receivables are required for the calculation of turnover ratios, and the report only provides the year-end values.  The calculations below will use the year-end values as a proxy.</p>
<p><strong>Standalone:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Asset Turnover:</strong> Revenue / Average Total Assets.  Using year-end figures as a proxy, this is approximately (₹19,462.89 thousand / ₹18,41,663.05 thousand) ≈ 1.06.  This means that for every rupee of assets, the company generates approximately ₹1.06 in revenue.  A more accurate calculation would require average asset values.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Inventory Turnover:</strong> Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) / Average Inventory.  Using the year-end figures as a proxy, and using Net Cost of Material Consumed + Change in Inventory for COGS:  (₹15,11,535.24 thousand / ₹3,54,853.85 thousand) ≈ 4.26.  This indicates that the company sells and replaces its inventory approximately 4.26 times per year. A more accurate calculation would require average inventory values.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Receivables Turnover:</strong> Net Credit Sales / Average Accounts Receivable. Using year-end figures as a proxy and using Net Revenue from Operations as a proxy for Net Credit Sales: (₹19,101.22 thousand / ₹9,13,563.42 thousand) ≈ 0.21. This suggests that the company collects its receivables approximately 0.21 times per year, or about every 5 years. This is an extremely low turnover and indicates significant problems with receivables collection. A more accurate calculation would require average receivables values.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Consolidated:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Asset Turnover:</strong> Revenue / Average Total Assets. Using year-end figures as a proxy: (₹21,305.85 thousand / ₹18,48,961.19 thousand) ≈ 1.15. This means that for every rupee of assets, the company generates approximately ₹1.15 in revenue. A more accurate calculation would require average asset values.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Inventory Turnover:</strong> Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) / Average Inventory. Using year-end figures as a proxy, and using Net Cost of Material Consumed + Change in Inventory + Purchase of Services for COGS: (₹16,72,676.56 thousand / ₹3,54,853.85 thousand) ≈ 4.71. This indicates that the company sells and replaces its inventory approximately 4.71 times per year. A more accurate calculation would require average inventory values.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Receivables Turnover:</strong> Net Credit Sales / Average Accounts Receivable.  Using year-end figures as a proxy and using Net Revenue from Operations as a proxy for Net Credit Sales: (₹20,940.57 thousand / ₹9,08,385.20 thousand) ≈ 0.23. This suggests that the company collects its receivables approximately 0.23 times per year, or roughly every 5 years.  This extremely low turnover ratio indicates a substantial problem with receivables management.  A more accurate calculation would use average receivables.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Notes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Average Values:</strong> The calculations above use year-end values as a proxy for average values.  More accurate results would be obtained using average balances (the average of the beginning and ending balances) for assets, inventory, and receivables.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Industry Benchmarks:</strong> These ratios must be compared to industry averages to determine how efficiently SBC Exports Limited is utilizing its assets compared to its competitors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Receivables Turnover:</strong> The extremely low receivables turnover ratios in both standalone and consolidated calculations (0.21 and 0.23) are a significant red flag, suggesting significant problems with collecting payments from customers.  This needs immediate attention.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In conclusion, while the asset turnover ratios suggest reasonable asset utilization, the low receivables turnover ratio is a serious concern.  A complete and accurate analysis requires average balance sheet data and industry benchmarks for comparison.</p>

  Leverage Ratios
  <a class="anchor" href="#leverage-ratios">#</a>
</h3>
<p>To calculate use ratios, we&rsquo;ll use data from both the balance sheet and the income statement. Remember that all values are in thousands of Indian Rupees (₹&lsquo;000), and the calculations below are approximations due to rounding involved in prior calculations.</p>
<p><strong>Standalone:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Debt-to-Equity Ratio:</strong> Total Debt / Shareholders&rsquo; Equity = ₹2,72,703.52 thousand / ₹3,17,469.26 thousand ≈ 0.86. This indicates that for every rupee of equity, the company has approximately ₹0.86 in debt.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Debt-to-Assets Ratio:</strong> Total Debt / Total Assets = ₹2,72,703.52 thousand / ₹18,41,663.05 thousand ≈ 0.15. This shows that approximately 15% of the company&rsquo;s assets are financed by debt.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Interest Coverage Ratio:</strong> Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT) / Interest Expense.  Using a previously calculated approximation for EBIT and the reported interest expense:  ₹1,284.46 thousand / ₹59,220.70 thousand ≈ 0.02. This extremely low ratio indicates that the company&rsquo;s earnings are barely covering its interest expense.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Consolidated:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Debt-to-Equity Ratio:</strong> Total Debt / Shareholders&rsquo; Equity = ₹2,73,416.76 thousand / ₹3,17,545.59 thousand ≈ 0.86.  This indicates that for every rupee of equity, the company has approximately ₹0.86 in debt.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Debt-to-Assets Ratio:</strong> Total Debt / Total Assets = ₹2,73,416.76 thousand / ₹18,48,961.19 thousand ≈ 0.15. This shows that approximately 15% of the company&rsquo;s assets are financed by debt.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Interest Coverage Ratio:</strong> Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT) / Interest Expense. Using a previously calculated approximation for EBIT and the reported interest expense: ₹1,294.38 thousand / ₹59,249.09 thousand ≈ 0.02. This extremely low ratio indicates that the company&rsquo;s earnings are barely covering its interest expense.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Notes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Approximations:</strong>  These calculations are approximations due to rounding in previous computations and the use of year-end values instead of average values for debt and equity.  More precise calculations would require the use of average balances over the financial year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Industry Benchmarks:</strong> It is essential to compare these use ratios to industry averages to assess the company&rsquo;s financial risk profile relative to its competitors. The low interest coverage ratio is especially concerning, suggesting a high risk of defaulting on debt obligations if earnings decline.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Interpretation:</strong></p>
<p>The debt-to-equity and debt-to-asset ratios suggest a moderate level of financial leverage. However, the extremely low interest coverage ratio is a significant red flag.  This indicates that the company&rsquo;s ability to meet its interest payments is extremely precarious, and a decline in earnings could lead to financial distress.  A detailed analysis of the company’s debt structure, along with a comparison with industry benchmarks, is highly recommended.</p>

<p><strong>Number of Outstanding Shares:</strong> This information can be found in the company&rsquo;s shareholding pattern section of the annual report (or from financial websites).  The report shows a total of 31,74,60,000 shares.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Once you have these, you can calculate:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Market Capitalization:</strong> Current Market Price per Share * Number of Outstanding Shares</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>P/E Ratio:</strong> Current Market Price per Share / Earnings Per Share (EPS).  The report provides EPS values.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>P/B Ratio:</strong> Current Market Price per Share / Book Value per Share. The book value per share can be calculated using the shareholders’ equity from the balance sheet and the total number of shares.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dividend Yield:</strong> (Annual Dividend per Share / Current Market Price per Share) * 100. The report shows a recommended dividend of ₹0.05 per share.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dividend Payout Ratio:</strong> (Total Dividends Paid / Net Income) * 100.  The report shows total dividends paid.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In short, while the annual report provides the necessary <em>components</em> for calculating these ratios (EPS, book value, dividends), it does <em>not</em> calculate or present the ratios themselves because they are dependent on the constantly changing market price of the stock.  You need to obtain the current market price from a financial data provider to complete the calculations.</p>

<li><strong>Geographic Presence:</strong> Operates within India, with plans to expand into the Middle East.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>II. Limitations of the Analysis:</strong></p>
<p>The  annual report significantly lacks essential details for a more detailed business segment analysis:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Segmental Income Statements:</strong>  The report does not include separate income statements for each segment, hindering the precise calculation of operating margins and profitability for each business unit.</li>
<li><strong>Market Share Data:</strong> The report provides no information on the company&rsquo;s market share in any of its operating segments.</li>

<p><strong>B. Financial Risks:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Category:</strong> Debt Financing</p>
</li>

<p><strong>II.  Limitations:</strong></p>
<p>The annual report lacks a detailed risk assessment, including the specific probability and impact scoring for each risk factor.  The mitigation strategies above are inferred and may not be the exact strategies implemented by the company.

  ESG Ratings
  <a class="anchor" href="#esg-ratings">#</a>
</h3>
<p>The provided annual report does <em>not</em> include ESG ratings from any external rating agencies.  ESG ratings are provided by specialized agencies that assess companies based on their environmental, social, and governance performance.  The report details some ESG initiatives undertaken by SBC Exports Limited, but it does not include any scores or ratings from organizations like MSCI, Sustainalytics, Refinitiv, or others.

<h3 class="heading" id="esg-initiatives">
  ESG Initiatives
  <a class="anchor" href="#esg-initiatives">#</a>
</h3>
<p>SBC Exports Limited&rsquo;s annual report provides information on many environmental and social initiatives but is less specific about carbon footprint data, sustainability goals, and the details of governance practices.  Here&rsquo;s a summary based on the available information:</p>
<p><strong>I. Environmental Initiatives:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Eco-Friendly Dyeing Processes:</strong> The company is transitioning to waterless dyeing technologies to reduce water consumption and eliminate harmful chemical runoff.  This is presented as a significant initiative, but quantifiable results (reduction in water usage, chemical waste, etc.) are not provided.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Textile Recycling Program:</strong> The company has implemented a program to recycle post-consumer and post-industrial textile waste into new fabrics. While mentioned, the scale of the program (amount of waste recycled) is not quantified.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Energy Conservation:</strong>  The company installed solar panels on its manufacturing facilities, generating approximately 30% of its electricity from renewable sources.  However, this only speaks to electricity usage, and other energy sources are not considered.  Overall energy consumption is not reported.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>II. Carbon Footprint:</strong></p>
<p>The annual report does <em>not</em> provide a quantitative measure of its carbon footprint.  This is a essential piece of information for assessing a company&rsquo;s environmental impact and would typically include greenhouse gas emissions data.  The absence of this data limits a full assessment of the company&rsquo;s environmental performance.</p>
<p><strong>III. Social Initiatives:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR):</strong> The company transferred ₹15 Lakhs to SETH LADHU KARA CHARITIES to support projects in education, healthcare, and environmental sustainability. While a positive step, this is a small amount relative to the company&rsquo;s overall revenue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Employee Empowerment:</strong> The report mentions a commitment to fostering a culture of continuous learning and development for employees, but details about specific training programs or employee well-being initiatives are lacking.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Brand Ambassadors:</strong> The company uses brand ambassadors (actors and models) for marketing purposes.  While this is a social initiative, related to enhancing brand image and engaging consumers, it doesn&rsquo;t directly address social issues or community development.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>IV. Governance Practices:</strong></p>
<p>The annual report details the company&rsquo;s corporate governance structure, including the Board of Directors, its committees (Audit, Nomination &amp; Remuneration, Stakeholders Relationship, Risk Management), and their meetings. It also mentions adherence to the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, and other applicable laws.  However, specific governance practices beyond this high-level overview are not elaborated.</p>
<p><strong>V. Sustainability Goals:</strong></p>
<p>The report lacks a clear statement of specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) sustainability goals.  While various environmental and social initiatives are mentioned, there is no overall framework or targets outlining the company&rsquo;s ambitions for environmental performance, social impact, or governance improvements.  The absence of quantified targets for its sustainability initiatives hampers a thorough evaluation of the company’s long-term commitment.</p>
<p><strong>VI. Overall Assessment:</strong></p>
<p>SBC Exports Limited demonstrates some positive steps toward sustainability through its environmental initiatives (eco-friendly dyeing, recycling, solar power). However, a more detailed assessment is hampered by a lack of quantitative data on its carbon footprint, specific sustainability goals, and a detailed description of its broader governance practices.  The report mentions good intentions, but the absence of clearly defined targets and measurable results limits the possibility for an accurate assessment of the long-term commitment to sustainability.</p>

<p>The independent auditor, STRG &amp; Associates, Chartered Accountants, expressed an <strong>unmodified (clean) opinion</strong> on both the standalone and consolidated financial statements of SBC Exports Limited for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024.
