</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Severity:</strong> High. Restrictions on market accessibility and pricing environment volatility, alongside competitive intensity, directly impact profitability.</li>
<li><strong>Likelihood:</strong> High, due to the heavily regulated nature of the industry.</li>
<li><strong>Trend</strong>: Stable, as the risk is an ongoing concern.</li>
<li><strong>Mitigation Strategies:</strong> Continuous engagement with external stakeholders, industry-level initiatives, and advocating for favorable excise policies.</li>
<li><strong>Control Effectiveness:</strong> Partially Effective, demonstrated by securing pricing in several states but was still not enough to fully offset inflation.</li>
<li><strong>Potential Financial Impact:</strong> Significant, as pricing pressures could lead to margin compression and affect the Company&rsquo;s drive for double-digit topline growth and mid-high teen operating margins.</li>
<li><strong>Premiumisation Focus:</strong> A core part of USL&rsquo;s strategy is premiumisation, with the Prestige &amp; Above segment contributing 87% of net sales in FY24. A shift in consumers spending habits and choiceful consumption would be a severe impact.</li>
