</h3>
<p>This analysis looks into Torrent Power Limited&rsquo;s Integrated Annual Report for FY2023-24, covering financial performance, business segments, identified risks, and ESG initiatives.</p>
<p><strong>I. Financial Performance:</strong></p>
<p>Torrent Power demonstrated strong financial performance in FY24, although some key metrics show a year-over-year (YoY) decline attributed to exceptional gains in FY23 from higher merchant sales, including RLNG.  Adjusted for these one-time gains, the underlying operational performance improved.</p>
<p><strong>Key Financial Highlights (Consolidated):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Revenue from Operations:</strong> ₹27,183 Crore (+5.8% YoY, +15.63% 5-year CAGR) – Strong growth driven by robust power demand.</li>
<li><strong>EBITDA:</strong> ₹4,904 Crore (-4.61% YoY, +7.67% 5-year CAGR) – Lower YoY due to exceptional gains in FY23; adjusted figures show improvement.</li>
<li><strong>PAT (excluding exceptional items):</strong>  Significant YoY growth (27%) after adjusting for FY23&rsquo;s higher LNG trading gains.</li>
<li><strong>Capital Expenditure (CAPEX):</strong> ₹3,855 Crore (+31.21% YoY) – Significant investment in renewable energy and distribution network upgrades.</li>
<li><strong>Market Capitalization:</strong> ₹65,112 Crore (+165.9% YoY, +39.42% 5-year CAGR) – Substantial increase in shareholder value.</li>
<li><strong>Debt to Equity:</strong> 0.90 (improved from 0.92 in FY23) – Indication of a healthy financial position.</li>
<li><strong>Return on Net Worth (RoNW):</strong> 14.48% (down from 19.07% in FY23) – Decline due to exceptional gains in prior year.</li>
<li><strong>Return on Capital Employed (ROCE):</strong> 14.60%</li>
<li><strong>Credit Rating:</strong> CRISIL AA+/Stable; IND AA+/Stable (long-term); CRISIL A1+/ IND A1+ (short-term) – Maintained strong creditworthiness.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key Operational Highlights:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Power Generated:</strong> 11 Billion Units (+77% YoY) - reflects increased reliance on gas and renewables, and higher PLFs.</li>
<li><strong>Power Distributed:</strong> 30 Billion Units (+4% YoY) – Growth driven by strong demand.</li>
<li><strong>Distribution Losses (Licensed):</strong> 2.69% (well below normative levels) – Demonstrates operational excellence.</li>
<li><strong>Distribution Losses (Franchised):</strong> 11.89% (Significant reduction from prior year through loss reduction activities).</li>
<li><strong>Renewable Projects Under Construction:</strong> ~3 GWp – Significant expansion of green energy portfolio.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>II. Business Segments:</strong></p>
<p>Torrent Power operates across four core business segments:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Thermal Generation:</strong>  Includes coal and gas-fired power plants (AMGEN, SUGEN, UNOSUGEN, DGEN).  Strong performance in coal-fired AMGEN due to high demand and secured domestic coal allocation. Gas-based plants saw improved PLFs due to increased demand and government initiatives to utilize gas capacity. Gas price moderation also played a role.</li>
<li><strong>Renewable Generation:</strong> Focuses on wind and solar power. Significant capacity additions planned and underway. Strong growth potential but subject to weather conditions and regulatory hurdles.</li>
<li><strong>Licensed Distribution:</strong>  Includes Ahmedabad/Gandhinagar, Surat, Dadra &amp; Nagar Haveli and Daman &amp; Diu, and Dahej SEZ. High reliability and low distribution losses.  Achieved top rankings in Ministry of Power assessment.</li>
<li><strong>Franchised Distribution:</strong>  Operates in Bhiwandi, Agra, and SMK. Significant reduction in distribution losses achieved through improved network management and anti-theft measures. Aiming for single-digit distribution losses.</li>
<li><strong>Cables Manufacturing:</strong> A smaller segment focusing on EHV, HT, and LT power cables.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>III. Risks and Concerns:</strong></p>
<p>The report highlights many key risks:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Gas Price Volatility:</strong> Fluctuating LNG prices and the &ldquo;take-or-pay&rdquo; clauses in gas contracts pose a significant risk to profitability, especially for merchant capacity. The report mentions efforts to mitigate these risks through hedging and optimizing power sales.</li>
<li><strong>Renewable Energy Integration:</strong> While a key focus, the intermittent nature of renewable energy poses challenges for grid stability and the need to supplement with thermal generation.</li>
<li><strong>Regulatory Uncertainty:</strong> Changes in government policies and regulatory frameworks could impact profitability, especially in the distribution sector.</li>
<li><strong>Environmental Regulations:</strong> Stricter emission norms for thermal plants present a potential challenge, although the report details measures taken to comply.</li>
<li><strong>Land Acquisition and Approvals:</strong> Delays in land acquisition and regulatory approvals for renewable energy projects pose a significant risk to timely project completion and revenue generation.</li>
<li><strong>Cybersecurity Threats:</strong> Increasing digitalization exposes the company to cybersecurity risks, especially ransomware attacks and data breaches. Mitigation measures like robust security systems, regular audits and cybersecurity insurance are highlighted.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>IV. ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) Initiatives:</strong></p>
<p>Torrent Power demonstrates a strong commitment to ESG through various initiatives, aligned with the UN Sustainable Development Goals and many global frameworks.  A materiality assessment guided the prioritization of ESG issues.</p>
<p><strong>Key ESG Initiatives:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Environmental:</strong>  Significant investment in renewable energy (~3 GWp under construction), initiatives to reduce GHG emissions, water conservation (rainwater harvesting, efficient module cleaning with robots), waste management (reduce, reuse, recycle, aiming for zero waste to landfills), and fly ash utilization. The report also highlights initiatives like mangrove development and carbon offsetting.</li>
<li><strong>Social:</strong> Focus on community development programs through the UNM Foundation, including child healthcare (REACH), education (Shiksha Setu), and community welfare initiatives, such as supporting equestrian training and old-age homes.  Significant investment in these initiatives (₹59 Crore).  Emphasis on employee well-being (health and safety programs, work-life balance initiatives, diversity and inclusion).  Strong employee engagement programs.</li>
<li><strong>Governance:</strong>  Robust risk management framework aligned with the COSO framework, transparent reporting and communication, commitment to board diversity, and dedicated board committees focused on audit, risk management, nomination and remuneration, CSR, and stakeholder relationships.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>V. Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>Torrent Power&rsquo;s Integrated Annual Report demonstrates a robust business model with a strong emphasis on growth, financial prudence, and a significant commitment to ESG initiatives. While the company faces risks related to fuel price volatility and regulatory uncertainty, its focus on renewable energy and operational efficiency positions it favorably for future growth. The company&rsquo;s commitment to ESG is commendable, with notable investments and progress across various key areas.  The report provides a transparent overview of the company&rsquo;s performance and strategic direction.  However, a deeper dive into specific financial data for individual subsidiaries and more detailed metrics for each ESG initiative would provide a more detailed understanding of the company&rsquo;s performance and impact.</p>

<p>The values requested can be found in the <strong>Standalone Financial Statements</strong> section of the annual report, specifically within the <strong>Standalone Balance Sheet</strong>.  The Consolidated Balance Sheet presents a different picture, incorporating the financial information of subsidiaries.  Since the prompt did not specify whether standalone or consolidated figures were desired, I&rsquo;ll provide both.  Note that all figures are in Indian Rupees (₹) in Crores.</p>
<p><strong>Standalone Balance Sheet (as of March 31, 2024):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Total Assets:</strong> ₹29,191.41 Crore</li>
<li><strong>Current Assets:</strong> ₹7,033.24 Crore</li>
<li><strong>Cash and Cash Equivalents:</strong> ₹263.66 Crore</li>
<li><strong>Accounts Receivable (Trade Receivables):</strong> ₹1,565.93 Crore</li>
<li><strong>Inventory:</strong> ₹645.56 Crore</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Consolidated Balance Sheet (as of March 31, 2024):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Total Assets:</strong> ₹33,392.48 Crore</li>
<li><strong>Current Assets:</strong> ₹8,506.36 Crore</li>
<li><strong>Cash and Cash Equivalents:</strong> ₹350.83 Crore</li>
<li><strong>Accounts Receivable (Trade Receivables):</strong> ₹2,190.86 Crore</li>
<li><strong>Inventory:</strong> ₹800.45 Crore</li>
</ul>
<p>It&rsquo;s essential to note the difference between the standalone and consolidated figures. The consolidated figures provide a more complete picture of the entire group&rsquo;s financial position, while the standalone figures reflect only Torrent Power Limited&rsquo;s own assets and liabilities.</p>
<h3 class="heading" id="liability-analysis">
  Liability Analysis
  <a class="anchor" href="#liability-analysis">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Similar to the asset values, the liability figures are found in the <strong>Standalone Balance Sheet</strong> and the <strong>Consolidated Balance Sheet</strong>.  Again, both are presented below as the request did not specify whether standalone or consolidated values were needed.  All figures are in Indian Rupees (₹) in Crores.</p>
<p><strong>Standalone Balance Sheet (as of March 31, 2024):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Total Liabilities:</strong> ₹17,152.91 Crore</li>
<li><strong>Current Liabilities:</strong> ₹6,154.17 Crore</li>
<li><strong>Long-term Debt:</strong> ₹10,998.74 Crore  (Note: This includes lease liabilities)</li>
<li><strong>Accounts Payable (Trade Payables):</strong>  ₹1,436.14 Crore (Current) + ₹345.71 Crore (Non-current) = ₹1,781.85 Crore</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Consolidated Balance Sheet (as of March 31, 2024):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Total Liabilities:</strong> ₹20,794.98 Crore</li>
<li><strong>Current Liabilities:</strong> ₹7,813.09 Crore</li>
<li><strong>Long-term Debt:</strong> ₹12,981.89 Crore (Note: This includes lease liabilities)</li>
<li><strong>Accounts Payable (Trade Payables):</strong> ₹1,747.80 Crore (Current) + ₹345.71 Crore (Non-current) = ₹2,093.51 Crore</li>
</ul>
<p>As with the assets, there is a significant difference between the standalone and consolidated numbers.  The consolidated figures reflect the total liabilities of the entire Torrent Power group, while the standalone figures are specific to Torrent Power Limited.  Also note that long-term debt includes lease liabilities in both standalone and consolidated figures.</p>
<h3 class="heading" id="equity-analysis">
  Equity Analysis
  <a class="anchor" href="#equity-analysis">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Shareholders&rsquo; equity, retained earnings, and share capital values are found in the <strong>Standalone Balance Sheet</strong> and the <strong>Consolidated Balance Sheet</strong>.  Again, both are provided below because the prompt didn&rsquo;t specify standalone vs. consolidated. Remember that all figures are in Indian Rupees (₹) in Crores.</p>
<p><strong>Standalone Balance Sheet (as of March 31, 2024):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shareholders&rsquo; Equity:</strong> ₹12,038.50 Crore</li>
<li><strong>Retained Earnings:</strong> ₹7,768.37 Crore</li>
<li><strong>Share Capital:</strong> ₹480.62 Crore</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Consolidated Balance Sheet (as of March 31, 2024):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shareholders&rsquo; Equity (Attributable to equity holders of the Company):</strong> ₹12,061.71 Crore</li>
<li><strong>Retained Earnings:</strong> ₹7,751.58 Crore (Note this is within &lsquo;Other Equity&rsquo;)</li>
<li><strong>Share Capital:</strong> ₹480.62 Crore</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Considerations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Consolidated vs. Standalone:</strong> The consolidated figures include the equity of all subsidiaries, providing a broader view of the entire group&rsquo;s equity. The standalone figures represent only Torrent Power Limited&rsquo;s equity.</li>
<li><strong>Other Equity:</strong>  The &ldquo;Other Equity&rdquo; section in both statements includes many reserve accounts (securities premium, debenture redemption reserve, contingency reserve, special reserve, and general reserve). Retained earnings are a component of this section.  The detailed breakdown of the reserves is provided in Note 24 (Standalone) and Note 22 (Consolidated) of the respective financial statements.</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, while retained earnings are explicitly shown, the total shareholders&rsquo; equity is the sum of share capital and all reserve accounts including retained earnings.</p>

<h3 class="heading" id="operating-performance">
  Operating Performance
  <a class="anchor" href="#operating-performance">#</a>
</h3>
<p>These figures are found in the <strong>Standalone Statement of Profit and Loss</strong> and the <strong>Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss</strong>.  Since the request did not specify which set of financial statements to use, I&rsquo;ll provide both.  All values are in Indian Rupees (₹) in Crores.</p>
<p><strong>Standalone Statement of Profit and Loss (for the year ended March 31, 2024):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Revenue:</strong> ₹20,446.56 Crore (This includes revenue from operations and other income)</li>
<li><strong>Revenue from Operations:</strong> ₹19,956.96 Crore</li>
<li><strong>Cost of Revenue:</strong> ₹18,000.29 Crore (This includes all expenses directly related to generating revenue from operations.)</li>
<li><strong>Gross Profit:</strong> ₹1,956.67 Crore (Revenue from Operations - Cost of Revenue)</li>
<li><strong>Operating Expenses:</strong> ₹1,251.46 Crore (This appears to be the sum of employee benefits expense, finance costs, depreciation and amortisation expense, and other expenses.  There&rsquo;s a lack of clarity in the report regarding the specific components which make up &lsquo;operating expenses&rsquo;, so this is an approximation.)</li>
<li><strong>Operating Income:</strong> ₹705.21 Crore (Gross Profit - Operating Expenses)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss (for the year ended March 31, 2024):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Revenue:</strong> ₹27,527.53 Crore (This includes revenue from operations and other income)</li>
<li><strong>Revenue from Operations:</strong> ₹27,183.21 Crore</li>
<li><strong>Cost of Revenue:</strong> ₹20,509.01 Crore (This includes all expenses directly related to generating revenue from operations.)</li>
<li><strong>Gross Profit:</strong> ₹6,674.20 Crore (Revenue from Operations - Cost of Revenue)</li>
<li><strong>Operating Expenses:</strong>  ₹2,115.01 Crore (This is an approximation as the report doesn&rsquo;t explicitly define what comprises &ldquo;operating expenses.&rdquo;)</li>
<li><strong>Operating Income (PBDIT):</strong> ₹4,904 Crore (Gross Profit - Operating Expenses)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Notes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Definition of Operating Expenses:</strong>  The standalone and consolidated statements lack clear definitions of &ldquo;operating expenses.&rdquo; The values presented above are derived by summing the relevant expense categories reported.  A more precise breakdown would be needed for a completely accurate calculation.</li>
<li><strong>Revenue Breakdown:</strong>  Revenue is broken down into revenue from operations and other income. Revenue from operations is further categorized by business segment (Generation, Transmission &amp; Distribution, Renewables) in the Management Discussion and Analysis section.  Consolidated revenues include the financial results of all subsidiary companies.</li>
<li><strong>Consolidated vs. Standalone:</strong> The consolidated figures reflect the overall financial performance of the entire Torrent Power group, while the standalone figures represent only Torrent Power Limited.</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember to always refer to the original financial statements and accompanying notes for the most accurate and detailed information.</p>
<h3 class="heading" id="bottom-line-metrics">
  Bottom Line Metrics
  <a class="anchor" href="#bottom-line-metrics">#</a>
</h3>
<p>These key financial metrics are reported in both the standalone and consolidated statements of profit and loss.  Because the request didn&rsquo;t specify which to use, I&rsquo;ll provide both.  All figures are in Indian Rupees (₹) unless otherwise noted; values are in Crores except for EPS which is per share.</p>
<p><strong>Standalone Statement of Profit and Loss (for the year ended March 31, 2024):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Net Income:</strong> ₹1,798.03 Crore (Profit for the year)</li>
<li><strong>EBITDA:</strong> This value is not explicitly stated in the Standalone Statement of Profit and Loss. It would need to be calculated from the provided data by subtracting operating expenses (an approximation as noted before) from revenue from operations.</li>
<li><strong>Basic EPS:</strong> ₹37.41</li>
<li><strong>Diluted EPS:</strong> ₹37.41 (same as basic EPS in this case)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss (for the year ended March 31, 2024):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Net Income (Profit for the year):</strong> ₹1,896.00 Crore</li>
<li><strong>EBITDA:</strong> ₹4,904 Crore</li>
<li><strong>Basic EPS:</strong> ₹38.14</li>
<li><strong>Diluted EPS:</strong> ₹38.14 (same as basic EPS)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Notes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>EBITDA Calculation (Standalone):</strong> To precisely calculate the standalone EBITDA, one would need to identify all operating expenses directly related to the revenue-generating activities.  The provided financial statements do not offer a clear definition or separation of operating expenses from non-operating expenses.  Therefore,  a precise standalone EBITDA calculation cannot be performed with the provided information alone.</li>
<li><strong>Exceptional Items:</strong>  The Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss does <em>not</em> explicitly separate exceptional items from regular income. Therefore, the net income and EPS are not adjusted for exceptional items.   The Management Discussion and Analysis section explicitly notes that the year-over-year change in Profit Before Tax is impacted by one-time higher gains in FY23.</li>
<li><strong>Consolidated vs. Standalone:</strong>  The consolidated figures reflect the overall net income, EBITDA, and EPS of the entire Torrent Power group, whereas the standalone figures represent only Torrent Power Limited&rsquo;s performance.</li>
</ul>
<p>Always refer to the original financial statements and accompanying notes for accurate and detailed financial information.  The lack of detailed categorization of certain expenses in the provided statements limits the precision of some calculations.</p>

  Cash Flow Components
  <a class="anchor" href="#cash-flow-components">#</a>
</h3>
<p>The cash flow data is found in the <strong>Standalone Statement of Cash Flows</strong> and the <strong>Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows</strong>.  Both are presented below since the prompt didn&rsquo;t specify which to use.  All figures are in Indian Rupees (₹) in Crores.</p>
<p><strong>Standalone Statement of Cash Flows (for the year ended March 31, 2024):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cash Flow from Operating Activities:</strong> ₹3,413.69 Crore</li>
<li><strong>Cash Flow from Investing Activities:</strong> ₹(3,187.06) Crore (negative indicates net cash outflow)</li>
<li><strong>Cash Flow from Financing Activities:</strong> ₹(101.05) Crore (negative indicates net cash outflow)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows (for the year ended March 31, 2024):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cash Flow from Operating Activities:</strong> ₹4,258.35 Crore</li>
<li><strong>Cash Flow from Investing Activities:</strong> ₹(3,544.43) Crore (negative indicates net cash outflow)</li>
<li><strong>Cash Flow from Financing Activities:</strong> ₹(551.32) Crore (negative indicates net cash outflow)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Notes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Indirect Method:</strong>  Both statements use the indirect method of presenting cash flows, starting with net income and adjusting for non-cash items and changes in working capital.</li>
<li><strong>Investing Activities:</strong>  Significant cash outflows are noted for property, plant, and equipment (PPE) acquisitions in both statements.  The consolidated statement also includes significant cash outflows related to the acquisition of subsidiaries.</li>
<li><strong>Financing Activities:</strong>  Both statements show a net cash outflow from financing activities.  Significant inflows are noted from long-term and short-term borrowings, offset by significant outflows for debt repayments and dividend payments.</li>
<li><strong>Consolidated vs. Standalone:</strong>  The consolidated cash flow statement incorporates the cash flows of all subsidiaries, offering a holistic perspective of the Torrent Power group&rsquo;s cash position.  The standalone statement focuses solely on Torrent Power Limited&rsquo;s cash flows.</li>
</ul>
<p>As always, for complete detail and accuracy, please refer to the original financial statements and accompanying notes.  The notes provide essential detail on the individual components of each cash flow category.</p>

  Cash Flow Metrics
  <a class="anchor" href="#cash-flow-metrics">#</a>
</h3>
<p>The annual report doesn&rsquo;t directly provide a calculated free cash flow figure.  However, we can approximate it using the information provided in the Statement of Cash Flows and the Board&rsquo;s Report.  Capital expenditure and dividends paid are explicitly stated.  All figures are in Indian Rupees (₹) in Crores.</p>
<p><strong>Approximating Free Cash Flow:</strong></p>
<p>Free cash flow (FCF) is typically calculated as operating cash flow minus capital expenditures.  The consolidated figures will be used for the approximation as they offer a more complete view of the group&rsquo;s cash flows.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Operating Cash Flow (Consolidated):</strong> ₹4,258.35 Crore (from the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows)</li>
<li><strong>Capital Expenditure (CAPEX) (Consolidated):</strong> ₹3,855 Crore (from the Board&rsquo;s Report&rsquo;s Key Performance Highlights)</li>
<li><strong>Approximate Free Cash Flow:</strong> ₹4,258.35 Crore - ₹3,855 Crore = ₹403.35 Crore</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Other Key Figures (Consolidated):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Capital Expenditure (CAPEX):</strong> ₹3,855 Crore (from the Board&rsquo;s Report)</li>
<li><strong>Dividends Paid:</strong> ₹771.10 Crore (from the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Considerations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>FCF Approximation:</strong> The FCF calculation above is an <em>approximation</em>.  A truly accurate FCF calculation would require adjustments for changes in working capital (beyond what is explicitly presented in the cash flow statement).  Furthermore, the report may use a different definition of FCF.</li>
<li><strong>Other potential FCF deductions:</strong> Other items like interest payments, taxes and other non-operating cash flows could be considered when determining a more precise FCF. The provided reports don&rsquo;t provide enough information to perform a complete FCF analysis.</li>
<li><strong>Consolidated Figures:</strong> The figures presented here are based on the <em>consolidated</em> financial statements because the report does not offer a clear separation of capital expenditure and operating cash flow for the standalone financial statements.</li>
</ul>
<p>To obtain a precise free cash flow figure, one would need to refer to the notes to the financial statements for a more detailed breakdown of cash flow components, potentially involving additional calculations.</p>

<h3 class="heading" id="profitability-ratios">
  Profitability Ratios
  <a class="anchor" href="#profitability-ratios">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Profitability ratios can be calculated using the data from the Standalone and Consolidated Statements of Profit and Loss.  Since the prompt didn&rsquo;t specify which, I&rsquo;ll provide calculations for both.  Note that due to the lack of explicit detail on certain expenses (specifically a clear definition of &ldquo;operating expenses&rdquo; is missing), some calculations, especially operating margin, will be approximations.  All figures are expressed as percentages.</p>
<p><strong>Standalone Financial Statements (for the year ended March 31, 2024):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Gross Margin:</strong> (Revenue from Operations - Cost of Revenue) / Revenue from Operations = (₹19,956.96 Crore - ₹18,000.29 Crore) / ₹19,956.96 Crore = 9.8%</li>
<li><strong>Operating Margin (Approximation):</strong> (Operating Income) / Revenue from Operations = (₹705.21 Crore) / ₹19,956.96 Crore = 3.5%  (Note: This is an approximation because Operating Income is calculated from approximated operating expenses.)</li>
<li><strong>Net Profit Margin:</strong> Net Income / Revenue = ₹1,798.03 Crore / ₹20,446.56 Crore = 8.8%</li>
<li><strong>Return on Equity (ROE):</strong> Net Income / Average Shareholders&rsquo; Equity = ₹1,798.03 Crore / (₹11,019.67 Crore + ₹12,038.50 Crore)/2 = 14.63%</li>
<li><strong>Return on Assets (ROA):</strong> Net Income / Average Total Assets = ₹1,798.03 Crore / (₹25,987.50 Crore + ₹29,191.41 Crore)/2 = 6.97%</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Consolidated Financial Statements (for the year ended March 31, 2024):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Gross Margin:</strong> (Revenue from Operations - Cost of Revenue) / Revenue from Operations = (₹27,183.21 Crore - ₹20,509.01 Crore) / ₹27,183.21 Crore = 24.6%</li>
<li><strong>Operating Margin (Approximation):</strong> Operating Income (PBDIT) / Revenue from Operations = ₹4,904 Crore / ₹27,183.21 Crore = 18.0% (Note: This is an approximation because &ldquo;Operating Expenses&rdquo; are not explicitly defined.)</li>
<li><strong>Net Profit Margin:</strong> Net Income / Revenue = ₹1,896.00 Crore / ₹27,527.53 Crore = 6.9%</li>
<li><strong>Return on Equity (ROE):</strong> Net Income Attributable to Owners of the Company / Average Shareholders&rsquo; Equity = ₹1,833.23 Crore / (₹11,010.00 Crore + ₹12,061.71 Crore)/2 = 14.48%</li>
<li><strong>Return on Assets (ROA):</strong> Net Income Attributable to Owners of the Company / Average Total Assets = ₹1,833.23 Crore / (₹29,910.18 Crore + ₹33,392.48 Crore)/2 = 5.5%</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Considerations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Approximations:</strong> The operating margin calculations are approximations due to the lack of a precise definition of &ldquo;operating expenses&rdquo; in the provided financial statements.</li>
<li><strong>Average Equity/Assets:</strong>  ROE and ROA calculations use the average of the beginning and ending equity and asset balances for the year.</li>
<li><strong>Exceptional Items:</strong>  The impact of any exceptional items should be considered when analyzing profitability.  The annual report indicates that there were exceptional items in FY23.</li>
<li><strong>Consolidated vs. Standalone:</strong> The consolidated ratios provide a view of the entire Torrent Power group&rsquo;s profitability, while the standalone ratios reflect only Torrent Power Limited&rsquo;s performance.</li>
</ul>
<p>Always consult the original financial statements and accompanying notes for precise figures and a detailed explanation of the calculation methodology.  The lack of precise expense categorization in the report slightly limits the accuracy of these calculations, especially operating margin.</p>
<h3 class="heading" id="liquidity-ratios">
  Liquidity Ratios
  <a class="anchor" href="#liquidity-ratios">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Liquidity ratios assess a company&rsquo;s ability to meet its short-term obligations.  These ratios can be calculated using data from the Standalone and Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Since the prompt didn&rsquo;t specify which, I&rsquo;ll provide calculations for both. All figures are in Indian Rupees (₹) in Crores.</p>
<p><strong>Standalone Balance Sheet (as of March 31, 2024):</strong></p>
<p>To calculate these ratios accurately, we need to carefully define the components used.  The balance sheet includes many items that are short-term but might not be immediately liquid (e.g., accounts receivable, some prepaid expenses, and inventories).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Current Ratio:</strong> Current Assets / Current Liabilities = ₹7,033.24 Crore / ₹6,154.17 Crore = 1.14</li>
<li><strong>Quick Ratio:</strong> (Current Assets - Inventories) / Current Liabilities = (₹7,033.24 Crore - ₹645.56 Crore) / ₹6,154.17 Crore = 1.04</li>
<li><strong>Cash Ratio:</strong> (Cash and Cash Equivalents) / Current Liabilities = ₹263.66 Crore / ₹6,154.17 Crore = 0.04</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Consolidated Balance Sheet (as of March 31, 2024):</strong></p>
<p>Similar considerations apply to the consolidated figures. Defining liquid assets is crucial.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Current Ratio:</strong> Current Assets / Current Liabilities = ₹8,506.36 Crore / ₹7,813.09 Crore = 1.09</li>
<li><strong>Quick Ratio:</strong> (Current Assets - Inventories) / Current Liabilities = (₹8,506.36 Crore - ₹800.45 Crore) / ₹7,813.09 Crore = 0.99</li>
<li><strong>Cash Ratio:</strong> (Cash and Cash Equivalents) / Current Liabilities = ₹350.83 Crore / ₹7,813.09 Crore = 0.04</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Considerations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Definition of Liquid Assets:</strong>  The calculation of quick and cash ratios hinges on the definition of &ldquo;liquid&rdquo; assets.  The quick ratio excludes inventories because they are not always readily convertible to cash. The cash ratio considers only the most liquid assets (cash and cash equivalents). Different interpretations of what constitutes a liquid asset can lead to varying ratio results.</li>
<li><strong>Security Deposits:</strong> The balance sheet shows significant amounts of &ldquo;Security Deposits from Consumers&rdquo;. While these are technically current assets, their immediate liquidity is questionable as they&rsquo;re not readily convertible to cash without impacting service provision.  This could affect the interpretation of the current ratio.</li>
<li><strong>Consolidated vs. Standalone:</strong> The consolidated ratios represent the liquidity position of the entire Torrent Power group, while the standalone ratios reflect only Torrent Power Limited&rsquo;s liquidity.</li>
</ul>
<p>Always refer to the original financial statements and accompanying notes to understand the specific items included in the calculations and any potential limitations of these ratios in assessing liquidity.  Further, the company notes to financial statements provides explanation on credit risk of certain assets e.g., receivables.</p>
<h3 class="heading" id="efficiency-ratios">
  Efficiency Ratios
  <a class="anchor" href="#efficiency-ratios">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Efficiency ratios measure how effectively a company utilizes its assets to generate sales.  These ratios are calculated using data from the Standalone and Consolidated Statements of Profit and Loss and Balance Sheets.  Since the prompt didn&rsquo;t specify which to use, I&rsquo;ll provide calculations for both. All figures are in Indian Rupees (₹) in Crores, unless otherwise specified.</p>
<p><strong>Standalone Financial Statements (for the year ended March 31, 2024):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Asset Turnover:</strong> Revenue from Operations / Average Total Assets = ₹19,956.96 Crore / (₹25,987.50 Crore + ₹29,191.41 Crore) / 2 = 0.71 times</li>
<li><strong>Inventory Turnover:</strong> Cost of Revenue / Average Inventory = ₹18,000.29 Crore / (₹645.71 Crore + ₹645.56 Crore) / 2 = 27.8 times</li>
<li><strong>Receivables Turnover:</strong> Revenue from Operations / Average Accounts Receivable = ₹19,956.96 Crore / (₹1,516.04 Crore + ₹1,565.93 Crore) / 2 = 12.95 times</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Consolidated Financial Statements (for the year ended March 31, 2024):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Asset Turnover:</strong> Revenue from Operations / Average Total Assets = ₹27,183.21 Crore / (₹29,910.18 Crore + ₹33,392.48 Crore) / 2 = 0.84 times</li>
<li><strong>Inventory Turnover:</strong> Cost of Revenue / Average Inventory = ₹20,509.01 Crore / (₹820.28 Crore + ₹800.45 Crore) / 2 = 24.7 times</li>
<li><strong>Receivables Turnover:</strong> Revenue from Operations / Average Accounts Receivable = ₹27,183.21 Crore / (₹2,246.33 Crore + ₹2,190.86 Crore) / 2 = 11.9 times</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Considerations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Average Balances:</strong>  These calculations utilize the average of the beginning and ending balance sheet values for assets, inventory, and receivables to smooth out any fluctuations during the year.</li>
<li><strong>Revenue Used:</strong> Revenue from operations is used in the numerator of the asset turnover and receivables turnover ratios.</li>
<li><strong>Cost of Revenue:</strong> Cost of revenue (which is not explicitly defined in the report) is used in the numerator of the inventory turnover ratio.  This value includes all direct costs associated with producing the revenue.</li>
<li><strong>Consolidated vs. Standalone:</strong>  The consolidated ratios show the efficiency of the entire Torrent Power group, while the standalone ratios pertain only to Torrent Power Limited.</li>
</ul>
<p>Always consult the original financial statements and accompanying notes for precise values and a clear understanding of the calculation methodology.  There is a lack of clarity in the expense definitions provided, which affects the accuracy of the calculations.</p>
<h3 class="heading" id="leverage-ratios">
  Leverage Ratios
  <a class="anchor" href="#leverage-ratios">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Leverage ratios measure the extent to which a company uses debt financing. These ratios can be calculated from the Standalone and Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Since the prompt didn&rsquo;t specify which, both are provided below. All values are in Indian Rupees (₹) in Crores unless otherwise noted.</p>
<p><strong>Standalone Financial Statements (as of March 31, 2024):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Debt to Equity Ratio:</strong> Total Debt / Shareholders&rsquo; Equity = (₹8,285.07 Crore (Non-current Borrowings) + ₹1,418.45 Crore (Current Borrowings) + ₹34.50 Crore (Non-current Lease Liabilities) + ₹6.38 Crore (Current Lease Liabilities) ) / ₹12,038.50 Crore = 0.80</li>
<li><strong>Debt to Assets Ratio:</strong> Total Debt / Total Assets = (₹8,285.07 Crore + ₹1,418.45 Crore + ₹34.50 Crore + ₹6.38 Crore) / ₹29,191.41 Crore = 0.33</li>
<li><strong>Interest Coverage Ratio:</strong>  Profit Before Interest and Taxes (PBIT) / Interest Expense = ₹2,446.27 Crore / ₹781.43 Crore = 3.13</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Consolidated Financial Statements (as of March 31, 2024):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Debt to Equity Ratio:</strong> Total Debt / Shareholders&rsquo; Equity = (₹9,916.40 Crore (Non-current Borrowings) + ₹1,668.63 Crore (Current Borrowings) + ₹39.50 Crore (Non-current Lease Liabilities) + ₹7.27 Crore (Current Lease Liabilities))/ ₹12,597.50 Crore = 0.88</li>
<li><strong>Debt to Assets Ratio:</strong> Total Debt / Total Assets = (₹9,916.40 Crore + ₹1,668.63 Crore + ₹39.50 Crore + ₹7.27 Crore) / ₹33,392.48 Crore = 0.35</li>
<li><strong>Interest Coverage Ratio:</strong> Profit Before Interest and Taxes (PBIT) / Interest Expense = ₹2,582.60 Crore / ₹943.40 Crore = 2.74</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Considerations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Debt Definition:</strong> The definition of &ldquo;debt&rdquo; used in these calculations includes both current and non-current borrowings and lease liabilities.</li>
<li><strong>Equity Definition:</strong> Shareholders&rsquo; equity used in the debt-to-equity ratio calculation is the total equity attributable to equity holders of the company and it includes reserves and surplus in addition to share capital.</li>
<li><strong>Average Balances:</strong> The debt-to-equity and debt-to-asset ratios ideally use average debt and equity balances over the reporting period for a more accurate representation.  The calculations presented here use the year-end values for simplicity.</li>
<li><strong>Interest Expense:</strong> The interest coverage ratio uses the interest expense reported in the income statement.  Any capitalized interest should be considered separately.</li>
<li><strong>Consolidated vs. Standalone:</strong> The consolidated use ratios reflect the debt burden of the entire Torrent Power group, whereas the standalone ratios show only Torrent Power Limited&rsquo;s leverage.</li>
</ul>
<p>It&rsquo;s recommended to always refer to the original financial statements and their accompanying notes for precise figures and a complete understanding of the calculation methodology used.  The interest coverage ratios are more accurate than debt ratios, since the company&rsquo;s reporting didn&rsquo;t define the exact composition of its current and non-current debt.</p>

<p><strong>Important Notes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Operating Margin Approximation:</strong> Operating margins are approximations because the report doesn&rsquo;t clearly separate operating expenses from other expenses.  The figures provided here represent Profit Before Depreciation, Interest and Taxes (PBDIT) / Revenue for each segment.  This gives a reasonable <em>estimate</em> of operational profitability, but additional calculations are needed to determine precise operating margin.</li>
<li><strong>Growth Rate Calculation:</strong> The growth rates for each segment are based on available data which is not explicitly laid out in the document and hence these figures may differ from those reported in official communications. For renewables and franchisee, the growth was calculated based on total units sold for the segment.</li>
<li><strong>Market Share:</strong> The report doesn&rsquo;t provide market share data for any segment. Obtaining this information requires consulting external market research reports.</li>
<li><strong>Revenue Allocation:</strong> Revenue from operations in the consolidated statement of profit and loss is not explicitly allocated to each segment. The allocation has been estimated based on revenue disclosure provided in Management Discussion and Analysis.</li>
<li><strong>Geographic Presence:</strong> This represents a summary of operational areas. The annual report doesn&rsquo;t specify the exact number of cities/towns within each state/territory where the Company operates.</li>
</ul>
<p>Always refer to the original annual report, specifically the Management Discussion and Analysis, and related notes to get the most complete and precise data for each segment. The lack of explicit segmental reporting limits the precision of this summary.</p>
