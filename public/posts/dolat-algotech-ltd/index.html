I. Financial Performance:
DAL experienced substantial growth in FY2023-24 compared to FY2022-23. The key financial highlights are summarized below (figures in INR millions):

<p><strong>Key Observations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Significant revenue growth driven primarily by increased income from shares and securities trading.</li>
<li>Substantial increase in other income, potentially indicating successful investment strategies.</li>
<li>Profitability improved significantly across all metrics, suggesting efficient cost management and successful trading strategies.</li>
<li>Consolidated and standalone PAT figures are nearly identical, suggesting minimal contribution from subsidiaries.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Financial Ratios:</strong></p>
<p>The annual report provides many key financial ratios.  However, the interpretations given within the report are sometimes incomplete or lack context. A more thorough analysis reveals:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Current Ratio:</strong> Improved significantly from 2.17 to 3.45, indicating increased short-term liquidity.</li>
<li><strong>Debt-Equity Ratio:</strong> Decreased substantially from 0.22 to 0.11, signifying a reduction in financial use and improved financial health.</li>
<li><strong>Debt Service Coverage Ratio:</strong> Improved from 8.82 to 11.36, showcasing increased ability to service debt obligations.</li>
<li><strong>Return on Equity (ROE):</strong> Increased from 19.88% to 21.98%, reflecting higher profitability relative to shareholders&rsquo; equity.</li>
<li><strong>Return on Capital Employed (ROCE):</strong>  Improved substantially from 21.18% to 25.55%, indicating efficient utilization of capital.</li>
<li><strong>Net Profit Margin:</strong> Slightly decreased from 75.42% to 72.38%, although still exceptionally high.  This may be due to increased operating expenses.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>II. Business Segments:</strong></p>
<p>DAL operates primarily in a single segment: <strong>financial and insurance services</strong>.  This segment encompasses trading in shares, securities, liquid funds, and dividends.  The company does not have separate reportable segments. The nearly identical standalone and consolidated financial statements highlight the minimal influence of the subsidiary, Dolat Tradecorp.</p>
<p><strong>III. Risks and Concerns:</strong></p>
<p>The Management Discussion and Analysis section highlights many risks:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Market Volatility:</strong>  Fluctuations in the Indian capital market, influenced by economic growth, global geopolitical events, and domestic policy changes, pose a significant risk to profitability.</li>
<li><strong>Geopolitical and Economic Factors:</strong> International and domestic political instability, inflation, and commodity price volatility can negatively impact the company&rsquo;s performance.</li>
<li><strong>Cybersecurity and Data Privacy:</strong> Reliance on technology infrastructure necessitates robust cybersecurity measures to protect data and mitigate the financial implications of breaches.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>IV. ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) Initiatives:</strong></p>
<p>The Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report (BRSR) provides details of DAL&rsquo;s ESG performance:</p>
<p><strong>Environmental:</strong></p>
<p>DAL&rsquo;s environmental impact is minimal due to its nature as a financial services company. The report highlights negligible waste generation and energy consumption. However, they acknowledge the importance of data privacy and cybersecurity (considered under environmental risks) and have implemented risk mitigation strategies.  No significant environmental projects or initiatives are reported.</p>
<p><strong>Social:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Employee Well-being:</strong> DAL provides health insurance, gratuity, and ESI (Employees&rsquo; State Insurance) to its employees.  Focus is placed on employee retention and skill development, but detailed metrics are limited.  Differently-abled employees are not reported.</li>
<li><strong>Stakeholder Engagement:</strong> The company engages with shareholders, employees, bankers, vendors, and government regulators.  However, systematic engagement with community stakeholders and the vulnerable/marginalized population is primarily fulfilled through CSR contributions, not direct engagement.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Governance:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Board Composition:</strong>  The board demonstrates a balance between executive, non-executive, and independent directors, including a female director.  However, most of the directors are related.</li>
<li><strong>Committees:</strong> The company has well-defined audit, nomination &amp; remuneration, stakeholders&rsquo; relationship, risk management, and CSR committees with documented terms of reference.</li>
<li><strong>Compliance:</strong>  The company claims compliance with all mandatory SEBI corporate governance requirements.</li>
<li><strong>Whistleblower Policy:</strong> A Whistle Blower Policy is in place.</li>
<li><strong>Related Party Transactions:</strong>  Significant related party transactions are reported and justified, with approvals obtained in accordance with regulations.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>V. Overall Assessment:</strong></p>
<p>Dolat Algotech Limited&rsquo;s annual report showcases strong financial performance driven by its core business of securities trading.  The company demonstrates a commitment to corporate governance best practices with well-structured committees and adherence to regulations. However, the ESG disclosures, while compliant, are quite limited in scope and detail, especially regarding social and environmental performance beyond compliance and CSR.  The company has substantial assets in the form of liquid assets; which presents risks and is an area that warrants more detailed disclosures about risk management strategies.  Further details on employee retention, employee diversity, supply chain sustainability and broader community engagement would improve the report&rsquo;s transparency and provide a more holistic view of their sustainability efforts.</p>

<p>The provided annual report presents consolidated and standalone financial statements.  Here&rsquo;s a breakdown of the requested values from both, all figures in INR millions:</p>
<p><strong>Consolidated:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Total Assets:</strong> 9,357.83</li>
<li><strong>Current Assets:</strong> 4,495.15</li>
<li><strong>Cash and Cash Equivalents:</strong> This is spread across many line items:
<ul>
<li>Cash on Hand: 0.04</li>
<li>Balance with Banks (in current accounts): 71.98</li>
<li>Other Bank Balances (Unclaimed Dividend Accounts): 0.73</li>
<li>Investments (Liquid Mutual Funds): 104.26</li>
<li>Loans: 3.01</li>
<li>Other Financial Assets (including many components): 4,221.10</li>
<li><strong>Total (Implied):</strong> 4,471.12 (Note: this is an approximation due to many components being lumped together,  and the liquid mutual fund investment is pledged as collateral)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Accounts Receivable:</strong>  Not explicitly stated as a single line item. The information is distributed across many line items within &ldquo;Other Financial Assets&rdquo; and other current assets.</li>
<li><strong>Inventory:</strong> Not applicable. DAL is not a manufacturing or retail company.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Standalone:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Total Assets:</strong> 9,082.13</li>
<li><strong>Current Assets:</strong> 3,990.50</li>
<li><strong>Cash and Cash Equivalents:</strong> This is also spread across many line items and again includes pledged assets:
<ul>
<li>Cash on Hand: 0.04</li>
<li>Balance with Banks: 70.13</li>
<li>Other Bank Balances (Unclaimed Dividend Accounts): 0.73</li>
<li>Investments (Liquid Mutual Funds): 103.63</li>
<li>Loans: 3.01</li>
<li>Other Financial Assets (including many components): 3,822.57</li>
<li><strong>Total (Implied):</strong> 4,070.11  (Note: this is an approximation for the same reasons as the consolidated statement)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Accounts Receivable:</strong> Similar to the consolidated statements, the information is not presented as a single, readily identifiable figure.</li>
<li><strong>Inventory:</strong> Not applicable.  DAL does not hold inventory.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Note:</strong> The values for cash and cash equivalents are approximations because the report doesn&rsquo;t clearly separate all components.  Also, a significant portion of the liquid assets are pledged as collateral which would mean the available cash is less than the total reported liquid assets.  The lack of a clear &ldquo;Accounts Receivable&rdquo; line item reflects the nature of DAL&rsquo;s business, focusing on proprietary trading rather than typical accounts receivables from customers.</p>
<h3 class="heading" id="liability-analysis">
  Liability Analysis
  <a class="anchor" href="#liability-analysis">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Again, we need to look at both the consolidated and standalone financial statements.  The information isn&rsquo;t always presented in the exact way we might expect from a standard financial report.</p>
<p><strong>Consolidated:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Total Liabilities:</strong> 1,427.79</li>
<li><strong>Current Liabilities:</strong> 1,408.55</li>
<li><strong>Long-Term Debt:</strong> This is not a single line item but is included within the &ldquo;Borrowings&rdquo; line items,  and broken down as:
<ul>
<li>Non-Current Borrowings: 0.30</li>
<li>Current Borrowings: 840.68</li>
<li><strong>Total Borrowings:</strong> 840.98</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Accounts Payable:</strong> Not explicitly detailed. The figure is embedded within &ldquo;Other Current Liabilities&rdquo; (39.57).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Standalone:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Total Liabilities:</strong> 1,161.18</li>
<li><strong>Current Liabilities:</strong> 1,155.32</li>
<li><strong>Long-Term Debt:</strong> Similar to the consolidated statement, long-term debt is dispersed across different &ldquo;Borrowings&rdquo; lines.
<ul>
<li>Non-Current Borrowings: 0.30</li>
<li>Current Borrowings: 840.68</li>
<li><strong>Total Borrowings:</strong> 840.98</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Accounts Payable:</strong>  Similar to the consolidated statement, this is included within the &ldquo;Other Current Liabilities&rdquo; (39.48).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Considerations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Debt Classification:</strong> The categorization of debt (long-term vs. current) might be slightly different based on the specific terms of the borrowings.  The report doesn&rsquo;t provide complete details on every loan&rsquo;s maturity date.</li>
<li><strong>Accounts Payable:</strong>  The absence of a dedicated line item for &ldquo;Accounts Payable&rdquo; again reflects DAL&rsquo;s business model.  It&rsquo;s a proprietary trading firm, and its payables are more likely to be related to financial transactions (clearing houses, brokers, etc.) rather than typical vendor payables.  The figures are likely lumped into the &ldquo;Other Current Liabilities.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>In short, while total liabilities and current liabilities are clearly presented, precise figures for long-term debt and accounts payable require deeper analysis of the underlying loan agreements and a breakdown of the &ldquo;Other Current Liabilities&rdquo; category, which the report does not provide.</p>
<h3 class="heading" id="equity-analysis">
  Equity Analysis
  <a class="anchor" href="#equity-analysis">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a breakdown of shareholders&rsquo; equity, retained earnings, and share capital, using both the consolidated and standalone financial statements (figures in INR millions):</p>
<p><strong>Consolidated:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shareholders&rsquo; Equity:</strong>  This is further broken down in the statement of changes in equity.
<ul>
<li><strong>Share Capital:</strong> 176.00</li>
<li><strong>Retained Earnings:</strong> 7,636.75</li>
<li><strong>General Reserve:</strong> 108.23</li>
<li><strong>Other Detailed Income:</strong> (0.03)  (Note the negative value)</li>
<li><strong>Total Shareholders&rsquo; Equity:</strong> 7,920.95 (Note: this is the <em>attributable</em> amount to the shareholders)  The total equity also includes non-controlling interest.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Total Equity (including non-controlling interest):</strong> 7,928.04</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Standalone:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Share Capital:</strong> 176.00</li>
<li><strong>Retained Earnings:</strong> 7,636.75</li>
<li><strong>General Reserve:</strong> 108.23</li>
<li><strong>Other Detailed Income:</strong> (0.03)</li>
<li><strong>Total Shareholders&rsquo; Equity:</strong> 7,920.95</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Notes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Non-Controlling Interest:</strong> The consolidated statements include a &ldquo;Non-Controlling Interest&rdquo; portion of equity (9.09 in FY24). This represents the portion of the subsidiary&rsquo;s equity not owned by DAL.  The standalone statement only reflects DAL&rsquo;s own equity.</li>
<li><strong>Other Equity:</strong>  &ldquo;Other Equity&rdquo; encompasses retained earnings, the general reserve, and the impact of other detailed income. The general reserve is a legacy item from the previous Companies Act and shows how much of the profits were historically transferred to reserves.</li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, while share capital is consistently reported at 176.00 million in both statements, the retained earnings and the reported value of other detailed income are quite substantial portions of the equity, while the general reserve is quite small.  Understanding the makeup of shareholders&rsquo; equity and the total equity requires careful consideration of the components listed in the Statement of Changes in Equity.</p>

<p>The provided annual report does not explicitly break down the income statement into &ldquo;Cost of Revenue&rdquo; and &ldquo;Gross Profit&rdquo; in the way that a typical manufacturing or retail company would.  Dolat Algotech&rsquo;s business model, focused on proprietary trading of securities, doesn&rsquo;t lend itself to this traditional cost-of-goods-sold (COGS) categorization.  Their &ldquo;Revenue from Operations&rdquo; essentially represents the net gains from their trading activities after accounting for all directly related expenses.</p>
<p>Therefore, we can only present the available data. All figures are in INR millions:</p>
<p><strong>Consolidated:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Revenue:</strong> 3,314.82 (FY24), 2,413.37 (FY23)</li>
<li><strong>Cost of Revenue:</strong>  Not explicitly reported.  All direct costs associated with trading are likely included within the &ldquo;Expenses&rdquo; figures.</li>
<li><strong>Gross Profit:</strong> Not explicitly reported.  Since Cost of Revenue isn&rsquo;t separated, gross profit can&rsquo;t be calculated.</li>
<li><strong>Operating Expenses:</strong> 1,572.26 (FY24), 1,165.39 (FY23) (Note: This includes employee benefits, finance costs, depreciation, and other expenses.)</li>
<li><strong>Operating Income:</strong> This is not directly calculated, but it is implied from the profit before tax. This would be the total revenue minus the operating expenses (employee benefit expenses, depreciation and amortization, and other expenses.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Standalone:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Revenue:</strong> 2,173.55 (FY24), 1,537.98 (FY23)</li>
<li><strong>Cost of Revenue:</strong> Not explicitly reported.</li>
<li><strong>Gross Profit:</strong> Not explicitly reported.</li>
<li><strong>Operating Expenses:</strong> 1,092.30 (FY24), 856.76 (FY23) (Note:  Similar to consolidated, this is a summation of many expense categories. This includes employee benefits, finance costs, depreciation, and other expenses.)</li>
<li><strong>Operating Income:</strong>  Implied from the profit before tax, and not directly stated</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>In summary:</strong>  The financial statements provided don&rsquo;t present the traditional revenue, cost of revenue, and gross profit breakdown. The focus is on the net results of the trading activities rather than a detailed cost accounting. The operating income is therefore implied, rather than directly stated.</p>

</h3>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a summary of the Net Income, EBITDA, Basic EPS, and Diluted EPS values from Dolat Algotech Limited&rsquo;s annual report, using both consolidated and standalone figures.  All monetary values are in INR millions, and EPS values are in INR.</p>
<p><strong>Consolidated:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Net Income (Profit After Tax):</strong> 1,577.51 (FY24), 1,163.68 (FY23)</li>
<li><strong>EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization):</strong>  This is not explicitly provided. To calculate it we would need to add back interest expense, depreciation, and amortization to the profit before tax.  The report does not clearly separate finance costs.</li>
<li><strong>Basic EPS:</strong> 8.94 (FY24), 6.59 (FY23)</li>
<li><strong>Diluted EPS:</strong> 8.94 (FY24), 6.59 (FY23)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Standalone:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Net Income (Profit After Tax):</strong> 1,573.29 (FY24), 1,159.92 (FY23)</li>
<li><strong>EBITDA:</strong>  Again, this requires a calculation adding back interest, depreciation, and amortization to the profit before tax.  Precise calculation is impossible without further breakdown of finance costs and separation of operating and non-operating expenses.</li>
<li><strong>Basic EPS:</strong> 8.94 (FY24), 6.59 (FY23)</li>
<li><strong>Diluted EPS:</strong> 8.94 (FY24), 6.59 (FY23)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Note:</strong> The near-identical values for basic and diluted EPS suggest that the company does not have any dilutive securities outstanding (like convertible bonds or stock options) that would affect the diluted EPS calculation.  The lack of a clear EBITDA figure highlights a limitation of the report&rsquo;s financial disclosures – the necessary components to calculate this metric are not clearly separated.</p>

</h3>
<p>The cash flow statement is presented differently in the consolidated and standalone reports. Here&rsquo;s a breakdown of the operating, investing, and financing cash flows (in INR millions):</p>
<p><strong>Consolidated:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Operating Cash Flow:</strong> (120.85) (FY24), 787.00 (FY23)  (Note the negative value in FY24)</li>
<li><strong>Investing Cash Flow:</strong> 332.70 (FY24), (1,180.89) (FY23)</li>
<li><strong>Financing Cash Flow:</strong> (46.72) (FY24), (45.12) (FY23)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Standalone:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Operating Cash Flow:</strong> (450.03) (FY24), 457.95 (FY23) (Note the negative value in FY24)</li>
<li><strong>Investing Cash Flow:</strong> 554.40 (FY24), (432.58) (FY23)</li>
<li><strong>Financing Cash Flow:</strong> (44.00) (FY24), (44.00) (FY23)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key Observations and Important Considerations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Negative Operating Cash Flow (FY24):</strong>  Both the consolidated and standalone statements show negative operating cash flow for FY24. This is a significant finding, suggesting that the company&rsquo;s reported net income may not be entirely representative of its cash generating ability.  It could indicate issues with working capital management, significant non-cash expenses, or timing differences between revenue recognition and cash collection. Further investigation would be needed to determine the underlying reasons.</li>
<li><strong>Fluctuations in Investing Cash Flow:</strong>  Both statements show significant fluctuations in investing cash flow between the two years. This suggests substantial changes in investment activities, potentially related to buying/selling financial instruments.  This highlights the inherent volatility of the company&rsquo;s investment strategy.</li>
<li><strong>Minimal Financing Cash Flow:</strong> Financing cash flows are relatively stable and negative (due to dividend payments) in both years, reflecting minimal external financing activity.</li>
</ul>
<p>The differences between the standalone and consolidated cash flow statements are likely due to the transactions with and within the subsidiary company, Dolat Tradecorp.  The detailed reconciliation of these differences is not provided in the report.  The negative operating cash flows warrant further investigation to understand the underlying reasons, and might impact the overall assessment of the company&rsquo;s financial health.</p>
<h3 class="heading" id="cash-flow-metrics">
  Cash Flow Metrics
  <a class="anchor" href="#cash-flow-metrics">#</a>

<p>The provided annual report doesn&rsquo;t directly state &ldquo;Free Cash Flow&rdquo; (FCF).  FCF is usually calculated as operating cash flow less capital expenditures and this report doesn&rsquo;t give a clear separation of operating and non-operating activities.  Therefore, a precise FCF calculation is impossible.</p>
<p>However, we can extract the following information from the cash flow statements (in INR millions):</p>
<p><strong>Consolidated:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Capital Expenditure (CAPEX):</strong> This isn&rsquo;t explicitly shown as a single line item but is implied in the &ldquo;Purchase of property, plant, and equipment (net)&rdquo; within the investing cash flows: 34.96 (FY24), 8.43 (FY23)</li>
<li><strong>Dividends Paid:</strong> 44.00 (FY24), 44.00 (FY23)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Standalone:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Capital Expenditure (CAPEX):</strong>  Similar to the consolidated, CAPEX is implied from the &ldquo;Purchase of property, plant, and equipment (net)&rdquo; in investing cash flows: 34.96 (FY24), 8.43 (FY23)</li>
<li><strong>Dividends Paid:</strong> 44.00 (FY24), 44.00 (FY23)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Calculation Limitations:</strong></p>
<p>To calculate free cash flow accurately, we would need:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Precise Operating Cash Flow:</strong>  The reported operating cash flow includes various adjustments, and a clear separation between operating and non-operating cash flows is needed for accurate FCF calculation.</li>
<li><strong>All Capital Expenditures:</strong> The reported capital expenditures may not represent the entire CAPEX for the period.</li>
</ol>
<p>The nearly identical CAPEX figures in the standalone and consolidated reports are unexpected. We would anticipate some variation given that one includes the subsidiary&rsquo;s activities.</p>
<p>In summary:  While we have capital expenditure and dividend figures, a precise free cash flow calculation is not possible with the provided information.  The lack of granular detail in the cash flow statement hinders a complete financial analysis.</p>

  Profitability Ratios
  <a class="anchor" href="#profitability-ratios">#</a>
</h3>
<p>As previously noted, Dolat Algotech&rsquo;s business model (proprietary trading) doesn&rsquo;t lend itself to a traditional gross profit margin calculation because the cost of revenue isn&rsquo;t explicitly separated. Therefore, we can only calculate the operating and net profit margins, along with ROE and ROA using the provided data.  All percentages are calculated based on the consolidated financial statement.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Gross Margin:</strong> Not calculable due to the lack of a separate cost of revenue figure.</li>
<li><strong>Operating Margin:</strong> This would be calculated as Operating Income / Revenue.  However,  the annual report does not give a clear value for Operating Income.  Operating Income is implied but not explicitly reported. Therefore, this ratio is not directly calculable from the provided data.</li>
<li><strong>Net Profit Margin:</strong> Net Profit After Tax / Revenue = 1,577.51 / 3,767.73 = 41.85% (FY24); 1,163.68 / 2,790.90 = 41.74% (FY23)</li>
<li><strong>Return on Equity (ROE):</strong> Net Income / Average Shareholders&rsquo; Equity.  We&rsquo;ll approximate average equity by averaging the beginning and ending shareholders&rsquo; equity. Note that this calculation only includes shareholders&rsquo; equity attributable to owners of the company:
<ul>
<li>Average Shareholders&rsquo; Equity (FY24): (6,391.95 + 7,920.95) / 2 = 7,156.45</li>
<li>ROE (FY24): 1,577.51 / 7,156.45 = 22.04%</li>
<li>Average Shareholders&rsquo; Equity (FY23): (5,485.37 + 6,391.95) / 2 = 5,938.66</li>
<li>ROE (FY23): 1,163.68 / 5,938.66 = 19.60%</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Return on Assets (ROA):</strong> Net Income / Average Total Assets.  Similar to ROE, we&rsquo;ll approximate average total assets:
<ul>
<li>Average Total Assets (FY24): (8,044.04 + 9,357.83) / 2 = 8,700.94</li>
<li>ROA (FY24): 1,577.51 / 8,700.94 = 18.12%</li>
<li>Average Total Assets (FY23): (7,278.66 + 8,044.04) / 2 = 7,661.35</li>
<li>ROA (FY23): 1,163.68 / 7,661.35 = 15.18%</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
<p>While the net profit margin, ROE, and ROA show strong profitability, the absence of a clear separation of costs prevents the calculation of gross and operating margins. The high net profit margin is notable but may not fully reflect the operational efficiency as it does not account for the cost of revenue. Further details on the cost structure would be required for more detailed profitability analysis.</p>

  Liquidity Ratios
  <a class="anchor" href="#liquidity-ratios">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Dolat Algotech Limited&rsquo;s annual report provides the current ratio but not the quick ratio or cash ratio.  We can calculate the current ratio using the data provided, and then discuss why the other two ratios are difficult or impossible to calculate from the available information.  All calculations are based on the consolidated financial statements.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Current Ratio:</strong> Current Assets / Current Liabilities = 4,495.15 / 1,408.55 = 3.19 (FY24); 3,548.83 / 1,629.03 = 2.18 (FY23)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Quick Ratio (Acid-Test Ratio):</strong> (Current Assets - Inventory - Prepaid Expenses) / Current Liabilities.  This ratio is not directly calculable because:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Inventory:</strong>  Dolat Algotech does not have inventory.</li>
<li><strong>Prepaid Expenses:</strong>  While prepaid expenses are included in &ldquo;Other Current Assets,&rdquo; the specific amount isn&rsquo;t readily separated.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cash Ratio:</strong> (Cash and Cash Equivalents) / Current Liabilities.  This ratio is also difficult to calculate precisely due to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cash and Cash Equivalents:</strong>  The &ldquo;Cash and Cash Equivalents&rdquo; line item isn&rsquo;t a simple sum of cash and demand deposits. It includes many components (cash on hand, bank balances, liquid mutual funds, and other items, some of which are pledged as collateral) that aren&rsquo;t easily separated in the report.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
<p>Only the current ratio is easily calculated from the provided financial statements.  The quick and cash ratios cannot be calculated precisely because of the lack of sufficient detail regarding the composition of current assets. The current ratio shows an improvement in liquidity from 2.18 to 3.19 during FY24, suggesting better short-term solvency, but again, this calculation ignores the fact that a large portion of reported liquid assets are pledged.   More detailed breakdowns of the current asset components are needed for a full liquidity analysis.</p>
<h3 class="heading" id="efficiency-ratios">
  Efficiency Ratios
  <a class="anchor" href="#efficiency-ratios">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Dolat Algotech Limited&rsquo;s business model (proprietary trading of securities) significantly impacts the applicability of traditional efficiency ratios.  Let&rsquo;s examine each one:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Asset Turnover:</strong> Revenue / Average Total Assets.  Using the average total assets calculated in a previous response:</p>
<ul>
<li>Average Total Assets (FY24): 8,700.94</li>
<li>Asset Turnover (FY24): 3,767.73 / 8,700.94 = 0.43</li>
<li>Average Total Assets (FY23): 7,661.35</li>
<li>Asset Turnover (FY23): 2,790.90 / 7,661.35 = 0.36</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Inventory Turnover:</strong> Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory.  This ratio is <strong>not applicable</strong> to Dolat Algotech because it does not hold inventory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Receivables Turnover:</strong> Revenue / Average Accounts Receivable. This ratio is <strong>not directly calculable</strong> because:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Accounts Receivable:</strong>  The financial statements don&rsquo;t present a separate &ldquo;Accounts Receivable&rdquo; line item.  The amounts receivable and payable from trades are settled quickly and are included in other short-term financial assets and liabilities.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
<p>Only the asset turnover ratio is calculable, and it indicates how efficiently the company utilizes its assets to generate revenue.  The asset turnover is quite low, indicating that for every rupee of assets they only generate approximately 43 paise of revenue. However, this low ratio is consistent with the trading business model where asset turnover is not usually a key metric.  The inventory and receivables turnover ratios are not applicable or calculable due to the nature of Dolat Algotech&rsquo;s business, which doesn&rsquo;t involve holding significant inventory or extending credit to customers.</p>
<h3 class="heading" id="leverage-ratios">
  Leverage Ratios
  <a class="anchor" href="#leverage-ratios">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Let&rsquo;s calculate the use ratios for Dolat Algotech Limited using the consolidated financial statements.  Keep in mind that the precise calculation of these ratios can be affected by how &ldquo;debt&rdquo; is defined and categorized in the report.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Debt-to-Equity Ratio:</strong> Total Debt / Total Equity. We will need to make some assumptions here regarding the classification of debt.  The total borrowings  include both current and non-current liabilities.</p>
<ul>
<li>Total Debt (FY24): 1,427.79 (Total Liabilities)</li>
<li>Total Equity (FY24): 7,928.04 (includes non-controlling interest)</li>
<li>Debt-to-Equity Ratio (FY24): 1,427.79 / 7,928.04 = 0.18</li>
<li>Total Debt (FY23): 1,645.07</li>
<li>Total Equity (FY23): 6,398.97</li>
<li>Debt-to-Equity Ratio (FY23): 1,645.07 / 6,398.97 = 0.26</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Debt-to-Assets Ratio:</strong> Total Debt / Total Assets.</p>
<ul>
<li>Total Debt (FY24): 1,427.79</li>
<li>Total Assets (FY24): 9,357.83</li>
<li>Debt-to-Assets Ratio (FY24): 1,427.79 / 9,357.83 = 0.15</li>
<li>Total Debt (FY23): 1,645.07</li>
<li>Total Assets (FY23): 8,044.04</li>
<li>Debt-to-Assets Ratio (FY23): 1,645.07 / 8,044.04 = 0.20</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Interest Coverage Ratio:</strong> Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT) / Interest Expense.  This is challenging to compute precisely because:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>EBIT:</strong> The income statement doesn&rsquo;t clearly separate operating and non-operating income and expenses, making a precise EBIT calculation difficult.  In addition, the finance costs also include bank guarantee charges. The report uses different interest coverage ratios, excluding and including bank guarantee charges.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
<p>The debt-to-equity and debt-to-assets ratios indicate that the company&rsquo;s use decreased substantially in FY24 compared to FY23.   This suggests an improved financial position and reduced risk. However, without a precise calculation of EBIT, the interest coverage ratio can&rsquo;t be calculated accurately from the information given in the report.  To get a complete picture of the company&rsquo;s use position, a more detailed breakdown of the debt and expense components would be beneficial.</p>
<p>The debt ratios calculated above use total liabilities as a proxy for total debt. A more precise calculation would require a clear separation of financial liabilities from other liabilities.</p>

<p>The annual report doesn&rsquo;t directly provide the market capitalization, Price-to-Earnings (PE) ratio, Price-to-Book (PB) ratio, or dividend yield. These metrics require market data (share price and number of outstanding shares) that are not included in the report itself.  The report <em>does</em> provide information needed to calculate the dividend payout ratio.</p>
<p>To calculate these ratios, you would need the following information, <em>not included</em> in the provided annual report:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Market Capitalization:</strong>  Number of outstanding shares * current market price per share.</li>
<li><strong>Share Price:</strong>  The current market price of Dolat Algotech&rsquo;s shares.</li>
<li><strong>Earnings Per Share (EPS):</strong>  Already calculated in previous responses.</li>
</ul>
<p>With the above, here&rsquo;s how the ratios would be calculated:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>PE Ratio:</strong> Market Price per Share / Earnings Per Share (EPS)</li>
<li><strong>PB Ratio:</strong> Market Price per Share / Book Value per Share (Shareholders&rsquo; Equity / Number of Outstanding Shares)</li>
<li><strong>Dividend Yield:</strong> Annual Dividend per Share / Market Price per Share</li>
</ul>
<p>The report does provide the information necessary for calculating:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dividend Payout Ratio:</strong>  Total Dividends Paid / Net Income
<ul>
<li>Consolidated (FY24): 44 / 1,577.51 = 2.79%</li>
<li>Standalone (FY24): 44 / 1,573.29 = 2.80%</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>In summary:</strong>  The market cap, PE ratio, PB ratio, and dividend yield cannot be determined from the information in the annual report alone.  Only the dividend payout ratio is calculable and shows that approximately 2.8% of the net income was paid out as dividends in FY24.  To get the other ratios, you would need to obtain current market data for Dolat Algotech&rsquo;s share price.</p>

<p>Dolat Algotech Limited operates primarily in a single business segment: <strong>Financial and Insurance Services</strong>.  The annual report does <em>not</em> provide a breakdown into sub-segments, nor does it offer information on market share, key products (in the traditional sense), or specific geographic presence beyond stating that their operations are primarily national.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what we can extract from the report:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Segment Name:</strong> Financial and Insurance Services (this encompasses all their activities)</li>
<li><strong>Revenues:</strong>  The &ldquo;Revenue from Operations&rdquo; figures represent the total revenue from this segment.  See previous responses for the values.</li>
<li><strong>Growth Rates:</strong>  The growth rate of the overall revenue is already calculated in previous responses.  Again, this is for the overall segment and not broken down further.</li>
<li><strong>Operating Margins:</strong>  Not explicitly stated and not directly calculable. The income statement does not give a clear separation of operating costs from non-operating costs.</li>
<li><strong>Market Share:</strong> Not provided.</li>
<li><strong>Key Products:</strong>  The company doesn&rsquo;t sell &ldquo;products&rdquo; in the traditional sense. Its activities involve trading in shares, securities, liquid funds, and generating income from dividends and interest, which are not typically viewed as &ldquo;products&rdquo; in a traditional business sense.</li>
<li><strong>Geographic Presence:</strong> Primarily national (India). No international operations are mentioned.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>In summary:</strong> The annual report provides very limited segmental details.

<p>The annual report identifies many key risk factors, though it doesn&rsquo;t always explicitly categorize them or provide a quantitative assessment of impact severity and likelihood.  Here&rsquo;s a structured overview based on the information provided:</p>
<p><strong>I. Category: Market Risks</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Description:</strong> Fluctuations in Indian capital markets due to macroeconomic factors (economic growth, inflation, interest rates), geopolitical events, and domestic policy changes.</li>
<li><strong>Impact Severity:</strong> High (could significantly impact profitability and even solvency).</li>
<li><strong>Likelihood:</strong> High (inherent volatility in financial markets).</li>
<li><strong>Mitigation Strategies:</strong> Diversified trading strategies and prudent risk management, though specific strategies aren&rsquo;t detailed.</li>
<li><strong>Trends:</strong>  Global uncertainties and domestic policy shifts suggest ongoing and potentially increasing volatility.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>II. Category:  Economic and Geopolitical Risks</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Description:</strong> Geopolitical tensions, rising commodity prices, and global economic slowdowns can negatively influence market sentiment and investment opportunities.</li>
<li><strong>Impact Severity:</strong> High (could impact investment returns and trading opportunities).</li>
<li><strong>Likelihood:</strong> Moderate to High (depending on global events and domestic economic policies).</li>
<li><strong>Mitigation Strategies:</strong>  Not explicitly detailed in the report, though a diversified investment strategy would presumably play a role.</li>
<li><strong>Trends:</strong>  Ongoing geopolitical tensions and global economic uncertainty point to a potentially persistent risk.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>III. Category: Operational Risks</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Description:</strong>  Cybersecurity threats and data breaches could compromise sensitive information and cause significant reputational and financial damage.  This is implicitly included as a risk under the environmental risk factor, even though it is not environmental in nature.</li>
<li><strong>Impact Severity:</strong> High (potential for significant financial losses and reputational harm).</li>
<li><strong>Likelihood:</strong> Moderate (depending on the effectiveness of cybersecurity measures).</li>
<li><strong>Mitigation Strategies:</strong> The company mentions having a Technology Committee and Risk Management Committee focused on mitigation, but specific strategies and their effectiveness aren&rsquo;t detailed.</li>
<li><strong>Trends:</strong> Increasing sophistication of cyberattacks suggests an ongoing and possibly growing risk.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>IV. Category: Financial Risks</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Description:</strong>  Liquidity risk arising from mismatches between the maturities of financial assets and liabilities and credit risk from counterparties defaulting on obligations.</li>
<li><strong>Impact Severity:</strong>  High (liquidity problems could cripple operations; credit losses could reduce profitability).</li>
<li><strong>Likelihood:</strong> Moderate to High (depends on market conditions and counterparty creditworthiness).</li>
<li><strong>Mitigation Strategies:</strong> The company mentions maintaining sufficient cash and cash equivalents and using recognized financial institutions as counterparties. However, it does not include detailed risk mitigation strategies in the report.</li>
<li><strong>Trends:</strong>  Economic uncertainty could increase both liquidity and credit risks.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>V. Category: Regulatory Risks</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Description:</strong>  Changes in regulations, tax laws, and compliance requirements could increase compliance costs and reduce profitability.</li>
<li><strong>Impact Severity:</strong> Moderate to High (depending on the extent of regulatory changes).</li>
<li><strong>Likelihood:</strong> Moderate (depends on future governmental actions).</li>
<li><strong>Mitigation Strategies:</strong>  Staying current with regulations and proactively addressing compliance requirements.</li>
<li><strong>Trends:</strong>  The evolving regulatory landscape suggests ongoing monitoring and adaptation are necessary.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Limitations of the Report&rsquo;s Risk Disclosure:</strong></p>
<p>The report&rsquo;s risk discussion lacks quantifiable metrics (likelihood and impact severity scores) to assess the materiality of these risks.  Further, the discussion of mitigation strategies is quite general, hindering a full evaluation of their effectiveness.  A more robust risk management framework within the annual report would increase investor confidence and support better decision making.</p>

<p>Dolat Algotech Limited&rsquo;s management discussion and analysis section offers insights into their strategies, competitive advantages, market conditions, challenges, and opportunities, although some aspects are only implicitly addressed.</p>
<p><strong>I. Key Strategies:</strong></p>
<p>The report doesn&rsquo;t explicitly list &ldquo;key strategies&rdquo; in a bullet-point format. However, we can infer strategies from their operations and financial performance:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Diversified Trading Strategy:</strong> The company likely employs a diversified approach to trading various securities and financial instruments to mitigate risk and capitalize on various market opportunities.  The report does not however specify what the individual strategies are.</li>
<li><strong>Investment Management:</strong>  Successful investment in liquid funds and other instruments contributes significantly to overall income, suggesting a well-defined investment management strategy.  The report however does not disclose what those strategies are.</li>
<li><strong>Liquidity Management:</strong> Maintaining sufficient liquidity through cash and cash equivalents helps the company to meet its financial obligations and seize opportunities as they arise.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>II. Competitive Advantages:</strong></p>
<p>The report doesn&rsquo;t directly state competitive advantages. However, we can infer some potential strengths:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Established Market Presence:</strong> As a long-standing and listed company, DAL possesses an established presence in the Indian capital market.</li>
<li><strong>Proprietary Trading Expertise:</strong> Their financial performance indicates substantial expertise in proprietary trading, which is their primary source of income.</li>
<li><strong>Financial Resources:</strong> The company&rsquo;s significant financial resources (high levels of liquid assets) allow it to undertake large-scale trading activities and benefit from market opportunities.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>III. Market Conditions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Positive Market Sentiment:</strong> The report notes that the Indian stock market performed exceptionally well in FY24, creating a favorable environment for DAL&rsquo;s trading activities.</li>
<li><strong>Volatility:</strong>  Despite the positive market sentiment, significant volatility remains a characteristic of the market, posing both risks and opportunities.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>IV. Challenges:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Market Volatility:</strong>  This is a recurring theme, emphasizing the inherent uncertainty in the financial markets.</li>
<li><strong>Geopolitical and Economic Uncertainty:</strong> Global and domestic events significantly influence market conditions, representing a major challenge to consistent profitability.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>V. Opportunities:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Growth in Indian Capital Markets:</strong> The continuing growth of the Indian capital market presents ongoing opportunities for increased trading volume and profitability.</li>
<li><strong>Innovative Investment Strategies:</strong>  The successful generation of other income suggests that the company sees opportunities in exploring and implementing innovative investment strategies.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Limitations of the Report&rsquo;s Discussion:</strong></p>
<p>The management&rsquo;s discussion of their strategies, advantages, and opportunities is quite general, lacking specific details.  For example, the specific investment strategies employed are not revealed and the risk mitigation strategies remain vaguely stated. A more detailed and concrete explanation of their competitive advantages and the specifics of their trading strategies would improve the report’s value and provide investors with more detailed information.</p>

  ESG Ratings
  <a class="anchor" href="#esg-ratings">#</a>
</h3>
<p>The provided annual report does <strong>not</strong> include ESG ratings from any external rating agencies.  While the report includes a Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report (BRSR), it does not mention any scores or ratings assigned by third-party ESG assessment providers.  Therefore, this information is not available within the provided document.</p>

  ESG Initiatives
  <a class="anchor" href="#esg-initiatives">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Dolat Algotech Limited&rsquo;s annual report, while including a Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report (BRSR), provides limited detail on many aspects of ESG performance.  Here&rsquo;s a summary based on the available information:</p>
<p><strong>I. Environmental Initiatives:</strong></p>
<p>The company&rsquo;s environmental initiatives are minimal, reflecting its nature as a financial services firm with limited direct environmental impact.  The report highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Low Energy Consumption:</strong> Minimal energy use is reported, primarily for office operations.</li>
<li><strong>Waste Management:</strong>  Negligible waste generation is noted, with a commitment to waste reduction and a plan to implement further improvements.</li>
<li><strong>Water Usage:</strong> Water usage is restricted to human consumption, indicating minimal environmental impact from water use.</li>
<li><strong>Data Privacy and Cybersecurity:</strong> Though not strictly &ldquo;environmental&rdquo;, the report highlights the importance of data privacy and cybersecurity measures as a significant risk factor, indicating a focus on responsible data handling.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>No specific environmental targets or goals are mentioned.</strong></p>
<p><strong>II. Carbon Footprint:</strong></p>
<p>No data on carbon emissions (Scope 1, 2, or 3) is provided in the report.  This omission is a significant gap, given the increasing focus on carbon reporting by many companies, even those with limited direct emissions.</p>
<p><strong>III. Social Initiatives:</strong></p>
<p>Social initiatives are primarily channeled through Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) activities.  The report mentions the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>CSR Spending:</strong>  Significant funds were allocated and spent towards CSR programs. However, specific details about the programs, beneficiaries, and their impact are limited.</li>
<li><strong>Employee Well-being:</strong>  The company provides health insurance, gratuity, and ESI benefits to its employees.  It also focuses on training and skill development to improve employee retention.  Information related to employee diversity and inclusion is not provided.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>IV. Governance Practices:</strong></p>
<p>The report highlights many governance practices, which are generally strong:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Board Composition:</strong>  A mix of executive, non-executive, and independent directors, including a female director, indicates a various board. However, a substantial number of directors are related parties.</li>
<li><strong>Committees:</strong>  Well-defined audit, nomination and remuneration, stakeholders&rsquo; relationship, risk management, and CSR committees are in place, with documented terms of reference.</li>
<li><strong>Compliance:</strong> The company claims compliance with all mandatory SEBI corporate governance requirements.</li>
<li><strong>Whistleblower Policy:</strong>  A Whistle Blower Policy is in place to enable ethical reporting.</li>
<li><strong>Related Party Transactions:</strong>  Related party transactions are reported, and the processes for their approval are in place.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>V. Sustainability Goals:</strong></p>
<p>The report does not state specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) sustainability goals.  While there is a commitment to responsible business conduct, this is largely expressed qualitatively rather than quantitatively through specific targets.</p>
<p><strong>Overall Assessment of ESG Disclosures:</strong></p>
<p>The ESG disclosures in the report are insufficient to provide a complete picture of DAL&rsquo;s sustainability performance.  The absence of key metrics, such as carbon footprint and specific social and environmental goals, is a notable weakness. While compliance with mandatory governance requirements is mentioned, the report needs significant improvement regarding the transparency and depth of its ESG reporting to meet evolving investor expectations.</p>

</h3>
<p>The annual report does <em>not</em> provide a separate line item for R&amp;D expenditure.  This is consistent with a financial services company like Dolat Algotech, where R&amp;D is typically not a significant expense.  Their activities primarily involve trading and investment, not product development or technological innovation in the traditional sense.</p>
<p>Regarding employee count, the report states that the total number of permanent employees as of the end of the financial year (March 31, 2024) is <strong>125</strong>.  The report also notes that there are no other (non-permanent) employees.</p>
<h3 class="heading" id="key-events">
  Key Events
  <a class="anchor" href="#key-events">#</a>
</h3>
<p>The annual report doesn&rsquo;t explicitly list &ldquo;significant events&rdquo; in a dedicated section. However, we can infer some key events based on the information provided:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Strong Financial Performance:</strong> The most significant event is the company&rsquo;s substantial growth in revenue and profitability during FY2023-24 compared to the previous year.  This highlights the success of their trading and investment strategies within a favorable market environment.</li>
<li><strong>Interim Dividends:</strong>  The declaration and payment of two interim dividends demonstrate a commitment to returning value to shareholders.</li>
<li><strong>Appointment of Independent Director:</strong> The appointment of a new Independent Director, Mr. Thomas Ritaldo Fernandes, strengthens the board&rsquo;s composition and governance structure.</li>
<li><strong>Increase in Borrowing Limit Proposal:</strong> The proposal to increase the company&rsquo;s borrowing limit, subject to shareholder approval, signals potential expansion plans or investments.</li>
<li><strong>Postal Ballots:</strong>  The conduct of postal ballots to obtain shareholder approval on related party transactions shows adherence to regulatory requirements.</li>
</ul>
<p>The report doesn&rsquo;t describe any significant operational events, mergers, acquisitions, divestitures, legal disputes, or other material occurrences beyond the financial results and governance-related activities.  The lack of detailed information prevents a more in-depth analysis of other potentially significant developments during the year.</p>

</h3>
<p><strong>Auditor&rsquo;s Opinion:</strong></p>
<p>The independent auditor, V. J. Shah &amp; Co. Chartered Accountants, issued an unqualified (unmodified) opinion on both the consolidated and standalone financial statements.  This means that, in their professional judgment, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position, financial performance, and cash flows of Dolat Algotech Limited in accordance with Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) and other applicable accounting principles.</p>
<p><strong>Key Accounting Policies:</strong></p>
<p>The annual report details many key accounting policies used in preparing the financial statements.  Here are some of the most significant:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Basis of Preparation:</strong> The financial statements are prepared in accordance with Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) and follow the historical cost convention, except for certain financial instruments measured at fair value.</li>
<li><strong>Current/Non-Current Classification:</strong> Assets and liabilities are classified as current or non-current based on criteria such as the operating cycle, intended use, and settlement timeframe.</li>
<li><strong>Property, Plant, and Equipment:</strong>  Measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Depreciation is calculated using the written-down value method.</li>
<li><strong>Impairment of Assets:</strong>  Assets are tested for impairment at each balance sheet date, with impairment losses recognized if the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount.</li>
<li><strong>Revenue Recognition:</strong> Revenue from trading activities is recognized on the trade date, while other income is recognized on an accrual basis.  Derivative contracts are accounted for based on their maturity or expiration.</li>
<li><strong>Financial Instruments:</strong> Classified and measured according to the business model and contractual cash flow characteristics (amortized cost, FVTOCI, FVTPL). Fair value is determined using a fair value hierarchy.</li>
<li><strong>Income Taxes:</strong>  Both current and deferred taxes are recognized.</li>
<li><strong>Provisions:</strong>  Recognized for present obligations that are probable and can be reliably estimated.</li>
<li><strong>Cash and Cash Equivalents:</strong> Includes cash in hand, bank balances, and short-term, highly liquid investments.</li>
<li><strong>Employee Benefits:</strong>  Short-term benefits are recognized when services are rendered; post-employment benefits (defined benefit plans) are accounted for using the projected unit credit method.</li>
<li><strong>Lease Accounting:</strong>  Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets are treated as operating leases, and lease payments are expensed.</li>
<li><strong>Segment Reporting:</strong>  The company does not have reportable segments.</li>
<li><strong>Events After Reporting Date:</strong>  Events providing evidence of conditions existing at the reporting date are adjusted; other material events are disclosed.</li>
<li><strong>Basis of Consolidation:</strong>  Subsidiaries are consolidated using the uniform accounting policies.</li>
</ul>
<p>These policies are essential for understanding how the company&rsquo;s financial information is presented and interpreted.  The complete list of accounting policies is provided in the annual report’s notes to the financial statements.</p>
