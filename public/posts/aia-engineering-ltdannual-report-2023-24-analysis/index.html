<li><strong>Deferred Tax Liabilities (Net):</strong> Increased by 30.67% from FY23 to FY24, driven by changes in temporary differences between book and tax accounting.</li>

  Analysis of the Metrics:
  <a class="anchor" href="#analysis-of-the-metrics">#</a>
</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Current Ratio:</strong> AIA&rsquo;s current ratio of 9.08 is extremely high compared to the hypothetical industry benchmark. This suggests potentially excessive liquidity or inefficient use of current assets.</li>
<li><strong>Debt-Equity Ratio:</strong> AIA&rsquo;s very low debt-equity ratio (0.07) compared to the industry indicates a highly conservative capital structure with minimal leverage.</li>
<li><strong>Inventory Turnover Ratio:</strong> The inventory turnover of 6.14 is slightly better than industry averages, suggesting good inventory management.</li>
<li><strong>Debtors Turnover (Days):</strong> AIA&rsquo;s debtors turnover of 125.03 days is significantly higher than the hypothetical industry benchmark. This warrants further investigation – it may indicate lenient credit terms or issues with collections.</li>
<li><strong>Return on Equity (ROE):</strong> An ROE of 18.94% is at a good place, and is in line or slightly above the hypothetical industry average.</li>
<li><strong>Net Profit and Operating Margins</strong>: AIA far outperforms with 27.8% and 26.2% respectively vs 8%-18% for the industry.</li>
<li><strong>Capital Work in Progress</strong>: AIA has 10% as CWIP, which is slightly higher. It indicates ongoing expansion.</li>

  Analysis of Accounting Quality and Regulatory Risk Assessment
  <a class="anchor" href="#analysis-of-accounting-quality-and-regulatory-risk-assessment">#</a>
</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Accounting Quality:</strong> The adoption of amendments to Ind AS 1 for disclosure of accounting policies, along with consistent application of accounting principles, enhances the transparency and comparability of the financial statements. The use of estimates and judgments (e.g., useful lives of assets, provisions, and expected credit losses) is inherent in financial reporting, and the company appears to have established processes for these, including actuarial valuations for employee benefits.</li>
<li><strong>Regulatory Risk:</strong> The Company faces ongoing regulatory scrutiny, particularly related to tax matters and anti-dumping investigations. These represent potential, but as yet unquantified, financial risks. The continued compliance with various regulations demonstrates a proactive approach to managing regulatory risk.</li>
