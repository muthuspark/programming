  Scenario Analysis and Sensitivity to Key Assumptions
  <a class="anchor" href="#scenario-analysis-and-sensitivity-to-key-assumptions">#</a>
</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Revenue Growth Sensitivity:</strong> The Company&rsquo;s 13.3% constant currency revenue growth in FY24 demonstrates resilience. If the global economy slows more than the predicted 3.2% growth rate, revenue growth could be negatively impacted, especially in sensitive sectors like BFS and Travel.</li>
<li><strong>Margin Sensitivity:</strong> Gross margins have remained flat at 32.6%. The stated increase in sales, marketing, and pre-sales costs, bucketed under SG&amp;A, impacted EBITDA margins. If these investments do not yield the expected return in terms of new client acquisition and deal closures, margins could be further pressured.</li>
<li><strong>Large Deal Sensitivity:</strong> The FY24 order intake of USD 1.97 billion (up 56% YoY) and the record 12-month executable order book of USD 1.02 billion provide near-term revenue visibility. However, any significant delays or cancellations in these large deals could negatively impact revenue projections.</li>
<li><strong>Partnership Success Sensitivity:</strong> The success of the partnership-led growth strategy depends on the effective collaboration and integration with platform partners. If these partnerships do not deliver the anticipated synergies, growth targets may be missed.</li>
<li><strong>Acquisition Success Sensitivity:</strong> If the planned Qualified Institutional Placement to fund acquisitions, up to INR 32,000 Mn, does not result in value-accretive acquisitions, the company could fail to meet its expansion goals.</li>
<li><strong>Macroeconomic Condition Sensitivity:</strong> Changes in macroeconomic and geopolitical environment affects the Company&rsquo;s risks related to foreign exchange, customers&rsquo; and prospective customers&rsquo; technology spending.</li>

  Analysis of Accounting Quality and Regulatory Risk Assessment
  <a class="anchor" href="#analysis-of-accounting-quality-and-regulatory-risk-assessment">#</a>
</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Accounting Quality:</strong> Generally high, evidenced by the unmodified audit opinion and adherence to Ind AS. The use of estimates (e.g., impairment provisions, revenue recognition on fixed-price contracts, fair value of financial instruments) introduces an element of subjectivity, but processes and controls appear robust.</li>
<li><strong>Regulatory Risk:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Moderate. The slight delays in depositing statutory dues, although quantified, indicate a need for strengthened internal processes.</li>
<li>The ongoing tax disputes, while assessed as not having a material adverse effect by management, present a potential risk that needs continuous monitoring.</li>
<li>The audit trail feature of the accounting software not being enabled at the database level for direct data changes poses some risk to financial reporting.</li>
