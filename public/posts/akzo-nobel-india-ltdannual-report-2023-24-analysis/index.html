  Accounting Quality and Regulatory Risk Assessment
  <a class="anchor" href="#accounting-quality-and-regulatory-risk-assessment">#</a>
</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Accounting Quality:</strong> The unqualified audit opinion suggests a high level of accounting quality. The consistent application of accounting policies and the use of estimates and judgments are disclosed. The Company uses a moving weighted average for inventory costing, which, while standard, can be less precise than FIFO or specific identification in times of fluctuating costs. The level of detail in the disclosures relating to employee benefit obligations, including actuarial assumptions, suggests a robust approach.</li>
<li><strong>Regulatory Risk Assessment:</strong> The main area of regulatory risk identified relates to ongoing tax litigations. While the Company states its belief (based on expert advice) that these disputes are unlikely to result in a material outflow of resources, the amounts involved are material. There is a risk of adverse rulings, potential increases in provisions, and cash outflows related to these tax disputes. Compliance with environmental laws is stated, but specific quantitative disclosures of emissions are provided in BRSR, limiting the ability to independently assess the risk. The backup procedure and the inability of reporting is a source for concern.</li>
