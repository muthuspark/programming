  Analysis of Accounting Quality and Regulatory Risk
  <a class="anchor" href="#analysis-of-accounting-quality-and-regulatory-risk">#</a>
</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Accounting Quality:</strong> The unmodified audit opinion suggests high accounting quality. The Company adheres to Ind AS, and the auditor&rsquo;s report indicates compliance. However, reliance on management&rsquo;s representations regarding funding and investment activities adds a minor element of risk.</li>
<li><strong>Regulatory Risk:</strong> The penalty imposed by BSE and NSE in the previous financial year is the only instance of a possible violation. The regulatory risk appears moderate, mainly associated with ongoing legal proceedings and the potential impact of those proceedings. The Company&rsquo;s compliance with listing regulations and timely filing of reports suggest a proactive approach to regulatory matters. The pending resolution of the land dispute, and adherence to regulations like Companies Act 2013, SEBI Listing Regulations adds a layer of risk.</li>
