  Strategic Risks
  <a class="anchor" href="#strategic-risks">#</a>
</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Severity:</strong> High</li>
<li><strong>Likelihood:</strong> Medium</li>
<li><strong>Trend:</strong> Increasing, evident from the intensifying competition in the premium middleweight (250-750cc) motorcycle segment with new entrants.</li>
<li><strong>Mitigation Strategies:</strong> Focus on customer-centricity, product differentiation, leveraging brand heritage, and expanding the product portfolio with category-defining launches.</li>
<li><strong>Control Effectiveness:</strong> Partially Effective. Royal Enfield maintained market dominance and achieved record business performance but also showed a slight decline in the domestic market share in the &gt;125cc segment from 31.8% in FY 2022-23 to 29.7% in FY 2023-24, and in the mid-size (250cc-750cc) motorcycles segment market share, from 92.8% to 88.5%, indicating the competitive pressure and the impact of global brands entering the market.</li>
<li><strong>Potential Financial Impact:</strong> Significant. Market share loss and pricing pressures could impact revenue and profitability.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="heading" id="operational-risks">
  Operational Risks
  <a class="anchor" href="#operational-risks">#</a>
</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Severity:</strong> Medium</li>
<li><strong>Likelihood:</strong> Medium</li>
<li><strong>Trend:</strong> Stable. Supply chain disruptions, particularly semiconductor shortages, and reliance on single-source vendors.</li>
<li><strong>Mitigation Strategies:</strong> Alternate vendor sourcing, inventory build-up, optimizing variant-feature mix, and diversifying manufacturing locations (e.g., CKD units outside India).</li>
<li><strong>Control Effectiveness:</strong> Moderately Effective. The Company has mitigated raw material shortages. Production capacity utilization improved to 77.35% from 69.35%.</li>
<li><strong>Potential Financial Impact:</strong> Moderate. Production delays and increased costs could affect profitability.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="heading" id="financial-risks">
  Financial Risks
  <a class="anchor" href="#financial-risks">#</a>
</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Severity:</strong> Medium</li>
<li><strong>Likelihood:</strong> Low</li>
<li><strong>Trend:</strong> Decreasing, due to the recovery in the domestic market and sustained growth in international markets.</li>
<li><strong>Mitigation Strategies:</strong> Cost reduction programs, value engineering, product price adjustments, and maintaining a net-debt-free status.</li>
<li><strong>Control Effectiveness:</strong> Highly Effective. The company achieved record Revenue from Operations (Rs. 16,536 Crores, up 14.50%), EBITDA (Rs. 4,327 Crores, up 25.65%), and PAT (Rs. 4,001 Crores, up 37.31%). Operating cash flow increased by 38.03% to Rs. 3,845.11 Crores.</li>
<li><strong>Potential Financial Impact:</strong> Moderate. High raw material costs and lower selling prices could impact profitability.</li>

  Compliance/Regulatory Risks
  <a class="anchor" href="#complianceregulatory-risks">#</a>
</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Severity:</strong> Medium</li>
<li><strong>Likelihood:</strong> Low</li>
<li><strong>Trend:</strong> Increasing. Policy changes and stringent regulations on EVs, ICE vehicles, and environmental and legal regulations in operational markets are emerging.</li>
<li><strong>Mitigation Strategies:</strong> Active monitoring of regulatory changes, technical expertise on global emissions, participation in industry forums (ACEM and SIAM), and flexible development processes.</li>
<li><strong>Control Effectiveness:</strong> High. The Company demonstrated a track record of managing transitions and scheduled execution of statutory projects and reported zero instances of non-compliance.</li>
<li><strong>Potential Financial Impact:</strong> Moderate. Non-compliance can lead to penalties and operational disruptions.</li>

  Emerging Risks
  <a class="anchor" href="#emerging-risks">#</a>
</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Severity:</strong> High</li>
<li><strong>Likelihood:</strong> Medium</li>
<li><strong>Trend:</strong> Increasing. The shift from ICE to EV, the ambiguity in regulatory requirements or the failure to meet compliance deadlines could impact the sales.</li>
<li><strong>Mitigation Strategies:</strong> Focus on the customer, a dedicated Advanced Engineering team to work on future requirements and a flexible development process to fast-track critical projects.</li>
