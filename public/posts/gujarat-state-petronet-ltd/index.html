<p>This analysis looks into the 2023-24 annual report of Gujarat State Petronet Limited (GSPL), examining its financial performance, business segments, risk factors, and ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) initiatives.</p>
<p><strong>I. Financial Highlights (Standalone &amp; Consolidated):</strong></p>
<p><strong>A. Standalone:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Significant Growth:</strong> Total income increased significantly from ₹1,930.21 crore in 2022-23 to ₹2,366.59 crore in 2023-24.  Profit before tax (PBT) showed similar growth, rising from ₹1,228.55 crore to ₹1,642.20 crore. Profit after tax (PAT) increased from ₹944.95 crore to ₹1,284.64 crore.  Earnings per share (EPS) rose from ₹16.75 to ₹22.77.</li>
<li><strong>Dividend Recommendation:</strong> The board recommended a dividend of ₹5 (50%) per share, subject to shareholder approval. This represents a substantial increase compared to the previous year&rsquo;s dividend.</li>
<li><strong>Zero Debt:</strong> GSPL maintained a zero-debt position.</li>
<li><strong>Key Ratios:</strong> Return on net worth (RONW) improved from 10.67% to 13.15%, indicating enhanced profitability. The net profit margin increased from 54% to 63%.  Liquidity ratios (current ratio) also improved significantly.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>B. Consolidated:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Revenue Growth:</strong> Consolidated revenue increased, although the percentage change compared to the standalone results is not explicitly stated and would require calculations based on the provided data.</li>
<li><strong>Profitability:</strong>  Consolidated PBT and PAT also grew, though the exact figures and growth percentages are not clearly presented in a summary table.</li>
<li><strong>Non-Controlling Interest:</strong> The impact of non-controlling interests in subsidiaries is significant, impacting both profit and equity.  The report shows a substantial non-controlling interest share in the consolidated results.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>II. Business Segments:</strong></p>
<p>GSPL&rsquo;s primary business is natural gas transmission through a vast pipeline network across Gujarat and Daman.  The report also highlights other segments:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Natural Gas Transmission:</strong> This is the core business, accounting for 97.59% of standalone turnover.  GSPL&rsquo;s extensive pipeline network (2706 km as of March 31, 2024) serves various industrial and commercial customers, along with city gas distribution (CGD) networks.  Significant growth was reported in gas transported (11159 MMSCM vs. 9253 MMSCM in the previous year).</li>
<li><strong>Electricity Generation (Wind Power):</strong> GSPL operates a 52.5 MW wind power project, generating electricity and contributing 1.58% to standalone turnover.</li>
<li><strong>Subsidiaries:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Gujarat Gas Limited (GGL):</strong> A significant city gas distribution (CGD) player across multiple states.</li>
<li><strong>GSPL India Gasnet Limited (GIGL):</strong> Developing pipeline projects in other states (Mehsana-Bhatinda and Bhatinda-Gurdaspur).</li>
<li><strong>GSPL India Transco Limited (GITL):</strong>  Developing a pipeline project (Mallavaram-Bhopal-Bhilwara-Vijaipur).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Associate Company:</strong> Sabarmati Gas Limited (SGL), involved in CGD.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>III. Risk Factors:</strong></p>
<p>The report identifies many key risks:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Affordability and Availability of Natural Gas:</strong>  Global and domestic gas price volatility poses a significant risk, impacting the affordability and demand for natural gas.  Geopolitical factors and weather conditions further complicate the outlook.</li>
<li><strong>Regulatory Risk:</strong> Changes in regulatory frameworks (PNGRB&rsquo;s tariff orders, for instance) can substantially affect GSPL&rsquo;s profitability and investment decisions.  The report highlights a significant tariff reduction for the high-pressure grid, which the company is contesting.</li>
<li><strong>Safety and Operational Risk:</strong>  Maintaining the integrity and safety of the extensive pipeline network is paramount.  Aging infrastructure, potential for unplanned shutdowns, and safety incidents are major concerns.</li>
<li><strong>Human Resources:</strong> Attracting and retaining skilled personnel in a competitive market is a challenge.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>IV. ESG Initiatives:</strong></p>
<p>GSPL demonstrates a commitment to ESG, with initiatives across environmental, social, and governance aspects:</p>
<p><strong>A. Environmental:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Renewable Energy:</strong> Operation of a significant wind power project.</li>
<li><strong>Green Gas Emission Reduction:</strong> Implementation of various measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Initiatives include gas monitoring devices to detect leaks and the &ldquo;Dial Before Dig&rdquo; campaign to minimize pipeline damage.</li>
<li><strong>Water Conservation:</strong> Implementation of water harvesting at many terminals and a zero-liquid-discharge system.</li>
<li><strong>Energy Efficiency:</strong> Measures to reduce energy consumption through efficient equipment and paperless documentation.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>B. Social:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR):</strong>  Significant spending on CSR projects focused on education, healthcare, and community development.  The report includes detailed impact assessments for many CSR projects.</li>
<li><strong>Employee Well-being:</strong> Detailed initiatives for employee health, safety, training, and development.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>C. Governance:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Board Composition:</strong>  The Board maintains a various structure with a focus on independent directors.</li>
<li><strong>Committees:</strong>  Multiple committees (audit, nomination &amp; remuneration, stakeholders&rsquo; relationship, risk management) ensure effective oversight of various aspects of the business.</li>
<li><strong>Transparency and Disclosure:</strong>  The report emphasizes transparency in dealings and adherence to regulations.  The company has policies covering various governance aspects like ethics, whistleblowing, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>V. Overall Assessment:</strong></p>
<p>GSPL demonstrates strong financial performance in 2023-24, driven primarily by its core natural gas transmission business.  However, the company faces risks related to gas price volatility, regulatory changes, and maintaining the safety of its infrastructure. Its commitment to ESG is evident through various initiatives, but the effectiveness of these initiatives and the long-term impact on the company&rsquo;s sustainability will need to be monitored.  The financial strength, combined with a clear focus on ESG, position GSPL well for future growth, though external factors remain critical to its long-term success.  The report&rsquo;s details, especially financial figures, are not always presented in a clear summary format, requiring calculations and in-depth reading to extract a complete picture.</p>

<p>The provided annual report gives values in Indian Rupees (INR) in Lacs (1 Lac = 100,000).  To get the values in INR, multiply the reported numbers by 100,000.</p>
<p>Based on the Standalone Financial Statements:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Total Assets:</strong> ₹1,108,085,78,000 (₹11,08,085.78 Lacs * 100,000)</li>
<li><strong>Current Assets:</strong> ₹1,80,800,24,000 (₹1,80,800.24 Lacs * 100,000)</li>
<li><strong>Cash and Cash Equivalents:</strong> ₹8,25,38,000 (₹825.38 Lacs * 100,000)</li>
<li><strong>Accounts Receivable (Trade Receivables):</strong> ₹14,123,13,000 (₹14,123.13 Lacs * 100,000)</li>
<li><strong>Inventory:</strong> ₹2,108,38,300 (₹21,083.83 Lacs * 100,000)</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on the Consolidated Financial Statements:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Total Assets:</strong> ₹1,905,584,26,000 (₹15,04,504.51 Lacs + ₹4,01,079.75 Lacs)* 100,000</li>
<li><strong>Current Assets:</strong> ₹4,01,079,75,000 (₹4,01,079.75 Lacs * 100,000)</li>
<li><strong>Cash and Cash Equivalents:</strong> ₹92,423,45,000 (₹92,423.45 Lacs * 100,000)</li>
<li><strong>Accounts Receivable (Trade Receivables):</strong> ₹1,14,810,62,000 (₹1,14,810.62 Lacs * 100,000)</li>
<li><strong>Inventory:</strong> ₹2,694,938,000 (₹26,949.38 Lacs * 100,000)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Note:</strong>  The Consolidated Total Assets calculation above adds the Non-Current and Current Assets. The Consolidated figures are significantly higher than the standalone figures due to the inclusion of subsidiaries, joint ventures, and associates in the consolidated statements.</p>
<h3 class="heading" id="liability-analysis">
  Liability Analysis
  <a class="anchor" href="#liability-analysis">#</a>
</h3>
<p>The annual report provides values in Indian Rupees (INR) in Lacs (1 Lac = 100,000). Remember to multiply the reported numbers by 100,000 to obtain the values in INR.</p>
<p>Based on the <strong>Standalone Financial Statements:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Total Liabilities:</strong> ₹81,078,79,000  (₹81,078.79 Lacs * 100,000)</li>
<li><strong>Current Liabilities:</strong> ₹24,091,31,000 (₹24,091.31 Lacs * 100,000)</li>
<li><strong>Long-Term Debt:</strong> ₹0 (The company reports zero debt)</li>
<li><strong>Accounts Payable (Trade Payables):</strong> ₹3,753,74,000 (₹3,753.74 Lacs * 100,000).  Note that this figure only includes current trade payables.</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on the <strong>Consolidated Financial Statements:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Total Liabilities:</strong> ₹4,67,320,40,000 (₹4,67,320.40 Lacs * 100,000)</li>
<li><strong>Current Liabilities:</strong> ₹3,02,514,37,000 (₹3,02,514.37 Lacs * 100,000)</li>
<li><strong>Long-Term Debt:</strong> ₹0 (The Group also reports zero long-term debt)</li>
<li><strong>Accounts Payable (Trade Payables):</strong> ₹71,407,49,000 (₹71,407.49 Lacs * 100,000). This is current trade payables only.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Note:</strong>  Consolidated figures are higher than standalone figures because they include the liabilities of subsidiaries, joint ventures, and associates.  The standalone figures represent only GSPL&rsquo;s own liabilities.  Also note that the term &ldquo;Long-Term Debt&rdquo; is used here to refer to debt with maturity beyond one year.  The report does not always explicitly categorize all items as current or non-current, requiring careful review of the detailed notes.</p>
<h3 class="heading" id="equity-analysis">
  Equity Analysis
  <a class="anchor" href="#equity-analysis">#</a>
</h3>
<p>The annual report presents values in Indian Rupees (INR) in Lacs (1 Lac = 100,000).  To obtain values in INR, multiply the reported figures by 100,000.</p>
<p>Based on the <strong>Standalone Financial Statements:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shareholders&rsquo; Equity:</strong> ₹1,027,006,99,000 (₹10,27,006.99 Lacs * 100,000)</li>
<li><strong>Retained Earnings:</strong> ₹9,27,848,21,000 (₹9,27,848.21 Lacs * 100,000)</li>
<li><strong>Share Capital:</strong> ₹5,642,11,400 (₹56,421.14 Lacs * 100,000)</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on the <strong>Consolidated Financial Statements:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shareholders&rsquo; Equity:</strong> ₹14,38,263,86,000 (₹14,38,263.86 Lacs * 100,000).  This includes equity attributable to owners of the parent company and non-controlling interests.</li>
<li><strong>Retained Earnings:</strong>  The consolidated retained earnings are not explicitly stated as a single figure but are embedded within the &ldquo;Other Equity&rdquo; section and require detailed calculations from the Statement of Changes in Equity.</li>
<li><strong>Share Capital:</strong> ₹5,642,11,400 (₹56,421.14 Lacs * 100,000)  This value remains the same as the standalone share capital because share capital is a parent-company item.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Note:</strong> The consolidated shareholders&rsquo; equity is significantly higher than the standalone equity because it includes the equity of subsidiaries, joint ventures, and associates.  Extracting the precise consolidated retained earnings figure would necessitate a detailed calculation from the provided Statement of Changes in Equity.  The consolidated share capital is the same as the standalone share capital, indicating that there were no changes to the Company&rsquo;s own equity shares during the year.</p>

<p>The annual report provides values in Indian Rupees (INR) in Lacs (1 Lac = 100,000).  Remember to multiply the reported Lacs figures by 100,000 to get the values in INR.</p>
<p>Based on the <strong>Standalone Financial Statements:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Revenue:</strong> ₹2,03,153,90,000 (₹2,03,153.90 Lacs * 100,000)</li>
<li><strong>Cost of Revenue:</strong>  The standalone report doesn&rsquo;t explicitly separate cost of revenue (direct costs specifically attributable to generating revenue) from other operating expenses.  The &ldquo;Gas Transmission Expenses&rdquo; and &ldquo;Cost of Material Consumed&rdquo; figures are presented but might not fully capture all direct costs. A precise Cost of Revenue figure cannot be definitively determined from the given information.</li>
<li><strong>Gross Profit:</strong> Cannot be calculated precisely without a clearly defined Cost of Revenue figure.</li>
<li><strong>Operating Expenses:</strong> ₹72,439,17,000 (₹72,439.17 Lacs * 100,000). Note that this includes items that might not be strictly considered &ldquo;operating expenses&rdquo; under all accounting definitions.</li>
<li><strong>Operating Income (Profit Before Tax):</strong> ₹1,64,220,15,000 (₹1,64,220.15 Lacs * 100,000). This figure represents profit before accounting for interest and taxes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on the <strong>Consolidated Financial Statements:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Revenue:</strong> ₹17,89,762,12,000 (₹17,89,762.12 Lacs * 100,000)</li>
<li><strong>Cost of Revenue:</strong> ₹12,14,483,36,000 (₹12,14,483.36 Lacs * 100,000).  This includes cost of materials consumed, gas transportation charges and changes in natural gas inventory for CGD.</li>
<li><strong>Gross Profit:</strong>  Cannot be directly determined from the available summary tables. It would require detailed calculations subtracting Cost of Revenue from Total Revenue.</li>
<li><strong>Operating Expenses:</strong> ₹15,21,052,57,000 (₹15,21,052.57 Lacs * 100,000).  Similar to standalone, some expenses included here might not fit the strict definition of &ldquo;operating expenses&rdquo; in all accounting frameworks.</li>
<li><strong>Operating Income:</strong> ₹2,87,357,64,000 (₹2,87,357.64 Lacs * 100,000) before considering exceptional items and share of profit/loss from joint ventures.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Note:</strong>  The consolidated figures are far larger than standalone values because of the inclusion of results from subsidiaries, associates, and joint ventures.  Precise calculation of Gross Profit in both standalone and consolidated scenarios demands a more detailed breakdown of the cost components.  The report should ideally provide a clear income statement outlining the standard revenue and expense categories.</p>

<li><strong>Net Income (Profit After Tax):</strong> ₹1,28,464,06,000 (₹1,28,464.06 Lacs * 100,000)</li>
<li><strong>EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization):</strong> This is not explicitly stated in a summary table but can be calculated by adding back Depreciation &amp; Amortization Expenses (₹19,200.72 Lacs) and Finance Costs (₹492.99 Lacs) to the Profit Before Tax (₹1,64,220.15 Lacs).  Therefore, EBITDA ≈ ₹1,83,913,86,000.</li>
<li><strong>Basic EPS:</strong> ₹22.77</li>
<li><strong>Diluted EPS:</strong> ₹22.77 (The report shows the basic and diluted EPS are the same).</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on the <strong>Consolidated Financial Statements:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Net Income (Profit After Tax):</strong> ₹2,18,373,03,000 (₹2,18,373.03 Lacs * 100,000)</li>
<li><strong>EBITDA:</strong> This requires a calculation by adding back Depreciation &amp; Amortization (₹66,381.98 Lacs), Interest (₹3,208.19 Lacs) and Taxes (₹75,100.04 Lacs)  to the Profit Before Tax and Exceptional Items (₹2,87,904.47 Lacs).  Therefore, EBITDA ≈ ₹4,22,674,68,000.</li>
<li><strong>Basic EPS:</strong> ₹29.41</li>
<li><strong>Diluted EPS:</strong> ₹29.09</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Note:</strong> The consolidated figures are much larger than the standalone figures due to the inclusion of the results from subsidiaries, joint ventures, and associates.  Also, the EBITDA calculation is an approximation as the precise components of the &ldquo;other expenses&rdquo; lines are not fully transparent in the report for a precise calculation.  The report should ideally provide a clear and concise summary of key financial metrics.</p>

</h3>
<p>The annual report provides cash flow data in Indian Rupees (INR) in Lacs (1 Lac = 100,000).  Remember to multiply the Lacs figures by 100,000 to get the values in INR.</p>
<p>Based on the <strong>Standalone Statement of Cash Flows:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cash Flow from Operating Activities:</strong> ₹1,17,242,47,000 (₹1,17,242.47 Lacs * 100,000)</li>
<li><strong>Cash Flow from Investing Activities:</strong> ₹(1,01,559,18,000) (₹(1,01,559.18) Lacs * 100,000). The negative sign indicates a net outflow of cash.</li>
<li><strong>Cash Flow from Financing Activities:</strong> ₹(28,425,39,000) (₹(28,425.39) Lacs * 100,000).  The negative sign indicates a net outflow of cash.</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on the <strong>Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cash Flow from Operating Activities:</strong> ₹2,80,339,53,000 (₹2,80,339.53 Lacs * 100,000)</li>
<li><strong>Cash Flow from Investing Activities:</strong> ₹(2,14,219,67,000) (₹(2,14,219.67) Lacs * 100,000). The negative sign indicates a net outflow of cash.</li>
<li><strong>Cash Flow from Financing Activities:</strong> ₹(54,733,26,000) (₹(54,733.26) Lacs * 100,000). The negative sign indicates a net outflow of cash.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Note:</strong>  The consolidated cash flow figures are substantially different from the standalone figures due to the inclusion of cash flows from subsidiaries, joint ventures, and associates.  The negative figures for investing and financing activities in both standalone and consolidated statements reflect net cash outflows during the year.  The considerable difference between the standalone and consolidated cash flows emphasizes the impact of the Group&rsquo;s subsidiaries on the overall financial position.</p>

  Cash Flow Metrics
  <a class="anchor" href="#cash-flow-metrics">#</a>
</h3>
<p>The annual report provides values in Indian Rupees (INR) in Lacs (1 Lac = 100,000).  Remember to multiply the Lacs figures by 100,000 to obtain values in INR.  Calculating Free Cash Flow requires careful interpretation of the report&rsquo;s data.</p>
<p>Based on the <strong>Standalone Statement of Cash Flows:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Capital Expenditure (CAPEX):</strong>  This isn&rsquo;t directly stated as a single figure but can be approximated from the investing activities section. The major component of cash outflow in investing activities is related to &ldquo;Acquisition of Property, Plant, and Equipment and Change in Capital Work in Progress&rdquo; which is ₹41,636.10 Lacs.  This is a reasonable approximation of CAPEX, though other smaller investing activities might slightly alter the precise figure.  Therefore, CAPEX ≈ ₹4,16,36,10,000.</li>
<li><strong>Dividends Paid:</strong> ₹28,210,57,000 (₹28,210.57 Lacs * 100,000)</li>
<li><strong>Free Cash Flow (FCF):</strong>  FCF calculation requires subtracting CAPEX from Cash Flow from Operating Activities.  Therefore, FCF ≈ ₹1,17,242,47,000 - ₹4,16,36,10,000 = ₹75,606,37,000.  This is an approximation because the CAPEX figure is an estimate based on the largest component of cash outflows from investing activities.</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on the <strong>Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Capital Expenditure (CAPEX):</strong> Similar to the standalone, a precise consolidated CAPEX value requires a detailed summation of all cash outflows related to capital asset acquisitions from all entities within the Group&rsquo;s consolidated accounts.  The provided information doesn&rsquo;t offer this in a single value. A reasonable approximation of CAPEX can be derived from the consolidated investing activities section (₹1,25,348.61 Lacs)  giving a figure of ₹1,25,34,861,000. This is likely an underestimate as it does not account for CAPEX from other entities within the group.</li>
<li><strong>Dividends Paid:</strong> ₹49,163,14,000 (₹49,163.14 Lacs * 100,000)</li>
<li><strong>Free Cash Flow (FCF):</strong>  Using the approximated CAPEX, Consolidated FCF ≈ ₹2,80,339,53,000 - ₹1,25,34,861,000 = ₹1,54,994,670,000.  However, this is a <em>rough estimate</em> given the lack of a fully detailed CAPEX figure and the potential inclusion of capital expenditures by subsidiaries, joint ventures, and associates that may not be entirely captured in the summarized consolidated cash flows.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Note:</strong> The  calculations for CAPEX and FCF above are approximations, relying on estimations from the cash flow statements.  A more precise calculation requires a complete breakdown of all investing activities across all entities within the Group&rsquo;s reporting structure and a clear definition of what constitutes CAPEX within the Company&rsquo;s accounting practices.  The significant differences between standalone and consolidated figures once again reflect the impact of including other entities in the consolidated statements.</p>

<p>Calculating profitability ratios accurately requires a precise cost of revenue figure, which is not explicitly provided in the summary tables of the annual report.  Therefore, the gross profit margin cannot be precisely computed.  However, we can calculate the other profitability ratios using the available data.  Remember that all figures are in Indian Rupees (INR).  The standalone figures are for GSPL alone, while the consolidated figures include all subsidiaries, joint ventures, and associates.  All values are approximate due to the lack of a precisely defined standalone cost of goods sold.</p>
<p>Based on the <strong>Standalone Financial Statements:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Gross Profit Margin:</strong> Cannot be calculated precisely due to insufficient data on direct costs.</li>
<li><strong>Operating Margin:</strong> (Operating Income / Revenue) * 100 ≈ (₹1,64,220,15,000 / ₹2,03,153,90,000) * 100 ≈ 80.8%</li>

</ul>
<p><strong>Important Notes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Approximations:</strong>  These calculations are approximations due to the limitations of the data presented in the report.  A more precise calculation of gross profit margin and other ratios would require a detailed income statement separating various cost components.</li>
<li><strong>Consolidated vs. Standalone:</strong> The consolidated ratios are significantly lower than the standalone ratios because the consolidated results encompass the performance of less profitable subsidiaries and joint ventures. The consolidated ROE calculation uses only equity attributable to the parent company&rsquo;s owners (excluding non-controlling interests), similar to the way ROE is frequently reported.</li>
<li><strong>Data Limitations:</strong> The lack of a standardized income statement format in the provided report makes a complete and precise ratio analysis challenging.</li>

<p>To calculate liquidity ratios, we need the values for current assets, current liabilities, inventory, and prepaid expenses from the Standalone and Consolidated Balance Sheets.  All figures are in Indian Rupees (INR), obtained by multiplying the Lacs figures in the report by 100,000.  The calculations below are approximations due to rounding differences and interpretations of certain line items within current assets and liabilities.</p>
<p><strong>Standalone Financial Statements:</strong></p>

<li><strong>Cash Ratio:</strong> (Cash and Cash Equivalents) / Current Liabilities = ₹92,423,45,000 / ₹3,02,514,37,000 ≈ 0.31</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Notes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Approximations:</strong> These calculations are approximate due to rounding in the reported figures and variations in the precise definition of certain components within current assets (e.g., the inclusion of other receivables in the quick ratio calculation).</li>
<li><strong>Consolidated vs. Standalone:</strong>  The consolidated current ratio is significantly lower than the standalone current ratio because the consolidated figures include the current assets and liabilities of all subsidiaries, associates, and joint ventures which could lead to a lower liquidity position in the consolidated figures.  This difference highlights the significance of integrating other entities in the consolidated accounts.</li>
<li><strong>Prepaid Expenses:</strong> The precise classification of prepaid expenses is not fully transparent from the given financial summaries.</li>
</ul>
<p>To perform a more precise ratio analysis, one needs access to the full detailed balance sheet that provides a complete breakdown of each line item within the current assets and liabilities.  The summaries provided only give aggregate figures.</p>

  Efficiency Ratios
  <a class="anchor" href="#efficiency-ratios">#</a>

<p><strong>Important Notes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Approximations:</strong>  These are approximations due to the use of simple averages and rounding differences in the reported financial data. More precise calculations would require a more detailed breakdown of the balance sheet items.</li>
<li><strong>Cost of Goods Sold:</strong> The standalone inventory turnover ratio is calculated using the standalone cost of materials consumed.  The consolidated inventory turnover uses the consolidated cost of materials consumed.</li>
<li><strong>Consolidated vs. Standalone:</strong> Consolidated ratios significantly differ from standalone ratios due to the inclusion of subsidiary, joint venture, and associate company data in the consolidated figures.  The size and nature of operations of different entities within the Group could contribute to these varying efficiency ratios.  The consolidated figures provide a broader picture of the Group&rsquo;s overall efficiency.</li>
<li><strong>Data Limitations:</strong> e available summaries lack detail, especially for some component of costs in the calculation of Cost of Goods Sold, potentially affecting the precision of the inventory turnover ratio.</li>

<h3 class="heading" id="leverage-ratios">
  Leverage Ratios
  <a class="anchor" href="#leverage-ratios">#</a>
</h3>
<p>The annual report indicates that GSPL has zero debt.  Therefore, the debt-to-equity and debt-to-asset ratios are both zero for both the standalone and consolidated financial statements.</p>
<p>The interest coverage ratio, however, can still be calculated, although it will only represent the ability to cover interest expenses relative to the earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT).  In the case of GSPL, its zero-debt position implies that the interest expense is primarily attributable to lease liabilities (and potentially other financing items if they exist but are not explicitly stated as debt).</p>
<p><strong>Standalone Financial Statements:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Debt-to-Equity Ratio:</strong> 0</li>
<li><strong>Debt-to-Asset Ratio:</strong> 0</li>
<li><strong>Interest Coverage Ratio:</strong>  EBIT / Interest Expense.  EBIT (Earnings Before Interest and Taxes) can be calculated as Profit Before Tax + Interest Expense = ₹1,64,220.15 Lacs + ₹492.99 Lacs = ₹1,64,713.14 Lacs. Therefore, Interest Coverage Ratio ≈ ₹1,64,713.14 Lacs / ₹492.99 Lacs ≈ 334.1</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Consolidated Financial Statements:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Debt-to-Equity Ratio:</strong> 0</li>
<li><strong>Debt-to-Asset Ratio:</strong> 0</li>
<li><strong>Interest Coverage Ratio:</strong>  EBIT / Interest Expense.  Again, a precise EBIT figure for the consolidated statements is needed to calculate the consolidated interest coverage ratio, but using the profit before tax and exceptional items and adding back interest expenses, EBIT ≈ ₹2,87,904.47 Lacs + ₹3,208.19 Lacs = ₹2,91,112.66 Lacs.   Therefore, the consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio ≈ ₹2,91,112.66 Lacs / ₹3,208.19 Lacs ≈ 90.7</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Notes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Zero Debt:</strong>  The zero debt significantly impacts the use ratios.  These ratios are essentially meaningless in the context of a zero-debt company.</li>
<li><strong>Interest Coverage Approximation:</strong> The interest coverage ratio calculation is approximate because the report might contain other interest-bearing items not explicitly identified as debt.  A complete income statement would allow for a more precise calculation.</li>
<li><strong>Consolidated vs. Standalone:</strong> Consolidated figures may reflect the interest coverage of other entities within the group, influencing the overall ratio.  The standalone ratio purely relates to GSPL&rsquo;s own operations and financial structure.</li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, while the use ratios are trivially zero due to the absence of debt, the interest coverage ratio indicates a strong ability to cover interest expenses relative to earnings. However, more precise analysis would be possible with a fully transparent income statement.</p>

<p>Calculating these market-based ratios requires information beyond what&rsquo;s directly in the annual report.  We need the current market price per share and the total number of outstanding shares to determine the market capitalization.  The report provides the number of outstanding shares but not the current market price.  Therefore, the calculations below will be illustrative only, using <em>hypothetical</em> market price values.  Assume the current market price per share for GSPL is ₹350.  Remember that all values will be in Indian Rupees (INR).</p>
<p><strong>Hypothetical Calculations (assuming ₹350 market price per share):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Market Capitalization:</strong>  Number of Outstanding Shares * Market Price per Share = 56,42,11,376 * ₹350 ≈ ₹19,747,397,760.</li>
<li><strong>Price-to-Earnings Ratio (PE Ratio):</strong> Market Price per Share / Earnings Per Share (EPS). Using the Standalone EPS of ₹22.77: PE Ratio (Standalone) ≈ ₹350 / ₹22.77 ≈ 15.38.  Using the Consolidated Basic EPS of ₹29.41: PE Ratio (Consolidated Basic) ≈ ₹350 / ₹29.41 ≈ 11.9. Using the Consolidated Diluted EPS of ₹29.09: PE Ratio (Consolidated Diluted) ≈ ₹350 / ₹29.09 ≈ 12.0.</li>
<li><strong>Price-to-Book Ratio (PB Ratio):</strong> Market Price per Share / Book Value per Share.  To calculate Book Value per Share, we need the total shareholders&rsquo; equity and the number of outstanding shares. Using Standalone values, Book Value per Share ≈ ₹10,27,006,99,000 / 56,42,11,376 ≈ ₹182.0.  Therefore, PB Ratio (Standalone) ≈ ₹350 / ₹182.0 ≈ 1.92.   Consolidated calculations would require the same process using the consolidated equity and outstanding shares.</li>
<li><strong>Dividend Yield:</strong> (Annual Dividend per Share / Market Price per Share) * 100. The recommended dividend is ₹5 per share.  Therefore, Dividend Yield ≈ (₹5 / ₹350) * 100 ≈ 1.43%.</li>
<li><strong>Dividend Payout Ratio:</strong> (Dividends Paid / Net Income) * 100. Using Standalone figures, Dividend Payout Ratio ≈ (₹28,210,57,000 / ₹1,28,464,06,000) * 100 ≈ 22%.  Consolidated calculations would use consolidated dividend paid and net income values.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Notes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hypothetical Market Price:</strong> e calculations above are based on a hypothetical market price of ₹350 per share.  The actual market price at any given time will determine the actual market cap, PE, PB, and dividend yield.</li>
<li><strong>Data Limitations:</strong>  Precise calculation of the PB ratio requires considering the definition of book value used (whether to consider only the parent company&rsquo;s equity or include the entire consolidated equity).</li>
<li><strong>Dividend Recommendation:</strong> The dividend yield and payout ratio are based on the <em>recommended</em> dividend.  The actual dividend paid might differ depending on shareholder approval.</li>
<li><strong>Time Sensitivity:</strong> Market-based ratios are dynamic and change constantly with fluctuations in market prices and company performance. The values calculated are a snapshot based on a specified hypothetical market price at a particular time and are subject to change.</li>
</ul>
<p>To obtain the actual values for these market-based ratios, one must refer to real-time financial data sources such as financial news websites or stock market data providers that provide live share price information for GSPL.</p>
