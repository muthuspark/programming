  Strategic Risks
  <a class="anchor" href="#strategic-risks">#</a>
</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Severity:</strong> High, due to the company&rsquo;s significant shift from equity-led business to credit business.</li>
<li><strong>Likelihood:</strong> Moderate. The credit business is described as &ldquo;relatively undiscovered&rdquo; and &ldquo;less competitive,&rdquo; reducing the likelihood of immediate strategic failure, but the transition itself presents inherent risks.</li>
<li><strong>Trend:</strong> Increasing. The company&rsquo;s revenue split shifted to 50:50 between investment inflows and credit/lending in FY 2023-24, up from 100% investments. Projected 60:40 (equity to credit) in the foreseeable future.</li>
<li><strong>Mitigation Strategies:</strong> Diversification into credit restructuring, leveraging equity investment gains for credit business capital, building a specialized team, and focusing on turning around acquired credit portfolios (RCFL and RHFL).</li>
<li><strong>Control Effectiveness:</strong> Partially effective. The acquisitions of RCFL and RHFL demonstrate an initial success, but the long-term effectiveness depends on successful operational integration and portfolio management.</li>

</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Severity:</strong> Moderate to High. The company&rsquo;s rapid expansion in the credit business, including the integration of acquired entities, poses operational challenges.</li>
<li><strong>Likelihood:</strong> Moderate. The growth in employee count (from 22 in FY 2022-23 to 328 in FY 2023-24) and remuneration payout (from ₹2.20 Crore to ₹28.73 Crore) indicates a significant operational scale-up.</li>
<li><strong>Trend:</strong> Increasing. Operational risks are heightened due to the integration of RCFL and RHFL&rsquo;s operations, systems, and personnel.</li>
<li><strong>Mitigation Strategies:</strong> Increased investment in talent, development of a credit collection team (120+ professionals), use of IT systems (SAP, E-collect mobile application), and focus on process digitalization.</li>
<li><strong>Control Effectiveness:</strong> Moderate. Systems are in place (LOS, LMS, E-collect), but their effectiveness in the expanded operational context needs further evaluation.</li>
