</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Monsoon Dependency (Agri Machinery):</strong> A below-normal monsoon could negatively impact rural incomes and, consequently, tractor sales. Conversely, an above-normal monsoon could boost sales.</li>

<li><strong>Commodity Prices (All Segments):</strong> Softening of commodity prices improved EBIT for the Agri Machinery segment. Fluctuations can directly impact profitability.</li>
<li><strong>Interest Rates (Construction Equipment):</strong> Stable interest rate regime will improve growth. Rising interest rates could impact infrastructure project financing and, consequently, demand for construction equipment.</li>
