  Strategic Risks
  <a class="anchor" href="#strategic-risks">#</a>
</h3>

<li><strong>Trend:</strong> Stable but increasing. Increasing global competition and energy transition could present challenges. The Petrochemical project brings about new risks with respect to price and competition.</li>
<li><strong>Mitigation Strategies:</strong> Diversification of supply, focus on the domestic market, expansion of regasification facilities, and entry into petrochemicals.</li>
<li><strong>Control Effectiveness:</strong> Partially Effective. Long-term contracts provide secured business, while infrastructure expansion increases capacity. The Petrochemical complex mitigates reliance.</li>

<li><strong>LNG Pricing:</strong> Volatility in global LNG spot prices, as seen in the past, poses a significant risk. The company&rsquo;s long-term contracts provide some stability, but spot purchases are exposed to price fluctuations. Sensitivity analysis shows significant impact on revenue based on price and INR/USD assumptions.</li>
<li><strong>Foreign Exchange Risk:</strong> The company is exposed to fluctuations in INR/USD exchange rates. A 10% movement in the exchange rate could significantly impact profit or loss, highlighting a need for robust hedging strategies.</li>

  Analysis of Accounting Quality and Regulatory Risk Assessment

</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Accounting Quality:</strong> The unqualified audit opinion, consistent application of accounting policies, and the presence of a robust internal control system suggest good accounting quality. However, the emphasis of matter regarding the &ldquo;Use or Pay&rdquo; dues indicates a potential area of concern, although the auditor&rsquo;s opinion is not modified. The lack of balance confirmation from customers regarding these dues increases the risk, but the provision made by the company is a mitigating factor.</li>
<li><strong>Regulatory Risk:</strong> The Company appears to be generally compliant with regulations, with past issues related to board composition. No penalties related to the capital market were noted. The legal proceedings, while ongoing, are disclosed, and the Company is actively contesting them.</li>
