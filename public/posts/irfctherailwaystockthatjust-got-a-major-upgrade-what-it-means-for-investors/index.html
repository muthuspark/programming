  What&rsquo;s the Big News?
  <a class="anchor" href="#whats-the-big-news">#</a>
</h2>
<p>The biggest catalyst for IRFC&rsquo;s recent rally is simple: the Government of India just gave the company &ldquo;Navratna&rdquo; status. Until now, IRFC was only a &ldquo;Mini-Ratna&rdquo; company, but this upgrade is a big deal!</p>
<p>So what does this Navratna thing actually mean? It&rsquo;s like getting a promotion at work with more freedom and responsibility. IRFC can now:</p>
<ul>
<li>Invest up to ₹1,000 crore (or 15% of its net worth) in a single project without asking the government for permission</li>
<li>Form partnerships and joint ventures more easily</li>
<li>Make business decisions faster without government red tape</li>
</ul>
<p>For us investors, this means the company can grow more quickly and seize new opportunities when they come up.</p>
<h2 class="heading" id="irfcs-business-more-than-just-trains">
  IRFC&rsquo;s Business: More Than Just Trains
  <a class="anchor" href="#irfcs-business-more-than-just-trains">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Most of us know IRFC as the financing arm of Indian Railways. They&rsquo;ve been the money behind about 80% of Indian Railways&rsquo; rolling stock (that&rsquo;s trains and wagons to you and me). But here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s interesting - they&rsquo;re now expanding beyond just railways.</p>
<p>IRFC is moving into:</p>
<ul>
<li>Power generation and transmission</li>
<li>Mining and fuel</li>
<li>Ports and warehousing</li>
<li>Telecom and hospitality</li>
</ul>
<p>They&rsquo;ve already secured some big deals:</p>
<ul>
<li>₹700 crore funding for 20 BOBR rakes for NTPC</li>
<li>₹3,190 crore loan for Patratu Vidyut Utpadan Nigam Limited</li>
<li>₹7,500 crore financing for NTPC Renewable Energy</li>
</ul>
<p>This diversification is exciting because it opens up new revenue streams. The company&rsquo;s CEO, Manoj Kumar Dubey, says they&rsquo;re currently earning margins of about 35-40 basis points on railway loans, but they could earn 100-150 basis points (or even up to 200-250 basis points) on these new ventures. That&rsquo;s potentially 5 times more profitable!</p>
<h2 class="heading" id="the-numbers-look-solid">
  The Numbers Look Solid
  <a class="anchor" href="#the-numbers-look-solid">#</a>
</h2>
<p>As an investor who likes to check the fundamentals, IRFC looks pretty strong:</p>
<ul>
<li>Revenue of over ₹26,600 crore</li>
<li>Profit after tax exceeding ₹6,400 crore (as of March 31, 2024)</li>
<li>Market cap of over ₹2 lakh crore</li>
<li>Assets under management of ₹4.61 lakh crore</li>
<li>Net worth around ₹52,000 crore</li>
</ul>
<p>The company has shown steady growth with average revenue growth of 15% and median profit growth of 11%. Its Return on Equity (ROE) stands at a healthy 13.7%, which is pretty good for a government-backed company.</p>
<p>What really stands out to me is that IRFC has ZERO NPAs (non-performing assets). In the lending business, that&rsquo;s like having a perfect driving record. They also have an incredibly high capital adequacy ratio (CRAR) of over 700%, which basically means they&rsquo;re very, very stable.</p>
<h2 class="heading" id="what-about-the-stock-performance">
  What About the Stock Performance?
  <a class="anchor" href="#what-about-the-stock-performance">#</a>
</h2>
<p>IRFC&rsquo;s stock history is interesting. It went public in January 2021 at an IPO price of ₹26. Now it&rsquo;s trading around ₹123.70 - that&rsquo;s a gain of about 375% in just over four years! Not too shabby.</p>
<p>Looking at different timeframes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Last 1 year: Down 18% (a bit of a rough patch)</li>
<li>Last 2 years: Up a massive 317%</li>
<li>Last 3 years: Up 446%</li>
</ul>
<p>The stock has pulled back from its highs, but that might present a buying opportunity. It seems to have found strong support around ₹115.</p>
<h2 class="heading" id="dividends-for-income-seekers">
  Dividends for Income Seekers
  <a class="anchor" href="#dividends-for-income-seekers">#</a>
</h2>
<p>If you&rsquo;re looking for income, IRFC has been a consistent dividend payer. The current dividend yield is about 1.27%. Since its IPO, they&rsquo;ve paid dividends 8 times - twice each year. Recent payments have been around ₹0.70-₹0.80 per share.</p>
<h2 class="heading" id="what-the-experts-are-saying">
  What the Experts Are Saying
  <a class="anchor" href="#what-the-experts-are-saying">#</a>
</h2>
<p>According to market expert Sumeet Bagadia from Choice Broking, IRFC shares have crucial support at ₹115. He suggests holding with a stop loss at ₹115 for a short-term target of ₹140. New investors might consider buying at current levels with the same stop loss.</p>
<p>However, I did notice that according to Trendlyne data, one analyst has a &ldquo;Strong Sell&rdquo; recommendation with a target price of ₹50 - that would be a 58% downside. But that seems to be a minority view given the company&rsquo;s growth and recent positive developments.</p>
<h2 class="heading" id="risks-to-watch-out-for">
  Risks to Watch Out For
  <a class="anchor" href="#risks-to-watch-out-for">#</a>
</h2>
<p>No investment is without risks. For IRFC, I&rsquo;m keeping an eye on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Their cautious approach to external borrowings due to the appreciating dollar</li>
<li>The fact that Indian Railways currently owes IRFC around ₹4.6 lakh crore</li>
<li>Any potential policy changes that could affect their relationship with Indian Railways</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="heading" id="my-take-as-a-retail-investor">
  My Take as a Retail Investor
  <a class="anchor" href="#my-take-as-a-retail-investor">#</a>
</h2>
<p>IRFC looks like a solid bet for a few reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Navratna upgrade gives them more freedom to grow</li>
<li>Their diversification beyond railways opens up more profitable business lines</li>
<li>Their financials are rock-solid with zero NPAs</li>
<li>The stock has found good support around ₹115</li>
</ol>
<p>If you&rsquo;re looking for a PSU stock with government backing, steady dividends, and growth potential, IRFC might be worth considering. I&rsquo;m thinking of adding some to my portfolio on any dips toward the ₹115 support level.</p>
<p>What do you think about IRFC? Are you holding or planning to buy? Let me know in the comments!</p>
