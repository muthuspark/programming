  1. Strategic Risks
  <a class="anchor" href="#1-strategic-risks">#</a>
</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Definition:</strong> Risks arising from adverse business decisions, improper implementation of decisions, or lack of responsiveness to industry changes. This includes risks associated with the bank&rsquo;s Vision 2026, new product launches, expansion into new markets, and competitive pressures.</li>
<li><strong>Severity:</strong> Potentially High. Failure to execute the bank&rsquo;s growth strategy could limit its ability to compete in the evolving banking landscape. The emphasis on new retail products (housing loans, business loans, etc.) introduces execution risk.</li>
<li><strong>Likelihood:</strong> Moderate. RBL Bank has demonstrated growth in the past, but the banking sector is competitive and subject to rapid changes.</li>
<li><strong>Trend:</strong> Increasing. The push for growth with profitability, along with the focus on new retail products and geographical expansion, suggests an upward trend in strategic risk, until these initiatives are established.</li>
<li><strong>Mitigation Strategies:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Diversification of the product portfolio (7 new retail products launched).</li>

  2. Operational Risks
  <a class="anchor" href="#2-operational-risks">#</a>
</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Definition:</strong> Risks arising from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, and systems, or from external events. This includes IT and cybersecurity risks, fraud, human error, and operational disruptions.</li>
<li><strong>Severity:</strong> High. The banking sector is heavily reliant on technology, making operational failures (especially cyber breaches) potentially very damaging.</li>
<li><strong>Likelihood:</strong> Moderate to High. The increasing reliance on digital channels (MoBank app, WhatsApp banking, etc.) expands the potential attack surface for cyber threats. The banking industry consistently faces fraud attempts.</li>
<li><strong>Trend:</strong> Increasing. The digitization trend and the Bank&rsquo;s expansion into new segments increases operational complexity.</li>
<li><strong>Mitigation Strategies:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Implementation of a comprehensive information security, data privacy, and cybersecurity framework, including Privacy Policies, ISO/IEC 27001: 2013 certification.</li>
<li>Adherence to international security standards and guidelines released by the Center for Internet Security (CIS) and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) for system hardening.</li>
<li>Automation of processes and simplification of operations (Automation Centre of Excellence).</li>
<li>Investment in a new in-house UPI switch, PowerPay 2.0, e-Sign, e-Stamp.</li>
<li>Development of a vulnerability management program.</li>
<li>Compliance with RBI guidelines.</li>
<li>Implementation of a Cyber Resilience program, including automation of information security processes and deploying new security solutions with emerging technologies.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Control Effectiveness:</strong> Moderate to Improving. The Bank reports a 60% reduction in customer complaints from FY22 to FY24 and a 70% decrease in problem incidences. Complaint Resolution Turn Around Time (TAT) improved to 76% in FY24. This points to improving controls, but the inherent risks remain.</li>
<li><strong>Potential Financial Impact:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Direct financial losses from fraud.</li>
<li>Reputational damage leading to customer attrition.</li>
<li>Regulatory penalties for non-compliance or breaches.</li>
<li>Increased operational costs for remediation and enhanced security.</li>

<li>Strong Underwriting Standards: Enhanced use of data intelligence and analytics for decision-making.</li>
<li>Contingent Provisions: Created a contingent provision of 1% on both credit card and microfinance portfolios.</li>
<li>Modified Credit Card Provisioning: Full provisioning at 120 days.</li>
<li>Target Operating Model (TOM) Framework: Manages concentration risks in the wholesale lending segment.</li>

</h4>
<p>During the previous year, loan servicing fees paid to business correspondents for services rendered towards sourcing and servicing of loans and other related activities was netted with &lsquo;Interest/discount on advances/bills&rsquo;. During the current year, the Bank has reclassified such fees under &lsquo;Other Expenditure&rsquo;.</p>

  Key Estimates and Judgments

<p>The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions. Significant areas involving estimates include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provisioning for loan losses and NPAs.</li>
<li>Valuation of investments.</li>
<li>Actuarial valuations for employee benefits (gratuity, pension, leave encashment).</li>
<li>Useful lives of fixed assets.</li>
<li>Fair value of financial instruments.</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="heading" id="accounting-quality-analysis">
  Accounting Quality Analysis
  <a class="anchor" href="#accounting-quality-analysis">#</a>
</h4>
<p>The unqualified audit opinion and the consistent application of accounting policies suggest a generally good quality of accounting. However, the reliance on management estimates and judgments in key areas like provisioning introduces inherent subjectivity.</p>

<p>The Bank&rsquo;s operations are highly regulated by the RBI. Key regulatory risks include:</p>
<ul>
