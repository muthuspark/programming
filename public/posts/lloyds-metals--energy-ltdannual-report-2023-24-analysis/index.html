</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Severity:</strong> High, due to the company&rsquo;s aggressive expansion into steel manufacturing and BHQ beneficiation, representing significant deviations from its established iron ore mining and DRI production.</li>
<li><strong>Likelihood:</strong> Medium. The success of forward integration into steel depends on external market factors like steel demand, pricing, and competition.</li>
<li><strong>Trend:</strong> Increasing. The MoU with the Maharashtra Government and land procurement for the slurry pipeline indicates progression of strategic expansion plans.</li>
<li><strong>Mitigation Strategies:</strong> Forward integration, diversifying product range (pellets, wire rods, HR coils).</li>
<li><strong>Control Effectiveness:</strong> Moderate, dependent on successful project execution and market acceptance of new products.</li>
<li><strong>Potential Financial Impact:</strong> High, given the capex plan of ₹32,700 crores. Success will result in becoming one of india&rsquo;s lowest cost steel producer. Failure can impact the value chain.</li>
