Changes in Language: # The language reflects a greater awareness of cost pressures compared to previous calls, where growth might have been the dominant theme. Areas of Confidence: # Management is confident in their ability to recover margins, drive volume growth, expand distribution, and leverage their marketing initiatives. They are particularly confident about the prospects of the Hazelnut acquisition and their long-term growth strategy. Areas of Concern: # The primary concern is clearly the volatility of raw material prices, particularly edible oil and potatoes. They express hope for government intervention to reduce import taxes on palm oil. Summary of Most Important Takeaways # Q3 was a challenging quarter: Bikaji, like other FMCG companies, faced significant headwinds from rising raw material costs, impacting margins. Reported volume growth was low, but management stresses revenue volume growth was better. Corrective actions are underway: Price increases and grammage adjustments have been implemented, with further price hikes planned. Management expects margin recovery in Q4 and a return to previous levels in the next two quarters. Long-term growth strategy remains intact: Bikaji is committed to its long-term volume growth targets, focusing on increasing direct reach, expanding distribution, and leveraging marketing campaigns. Strategic acquisition: The acquisition of Hazelnut Company is expected to contribute significantly to revenue in the coming year. QSR expansion: Bikaji is piloting QSR outlets, starting in Rajasthan, with potential future expansion. Commodity hedging is already done, except for edible oils. Download Transcript">

<li><strong>Q3 was a challenging quarter:</strong> Bikaji, like other FMCG companies, faced significant headwinds from rising raw material costs, impacting margins. Reported volume growth was low, but management stresses revenue volume growth was better.</li>
<li><strong>Corrective actions are underway:</strong> Price increases and grammage adjustments have been implemented, with further price hikes planned. Management expects margin recovery in Q4 and a return to previous levels in the next two quarters.</li>
<li><strong>Long-term growth strategy remains intact:</strong> Bikaji is committed to its long-term volume growth targets, focusing on increasing direct reach, expanding distribution, and leveraging marketing campaigns.</li>
<li><strong>Strategic acquisition:</strong> The acquisition of Hazelnut Company is expected to contribute significantly to revenue in the coming year.</li>
<li><strong>QSR expansion:</strong> Bikaji is piloting QSR outlets, starting in Rajasthan, with potential future expansion.</li>
<li>Commodity hedging is already done, except for edible oils.</li>
