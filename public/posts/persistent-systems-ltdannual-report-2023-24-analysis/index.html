  Accounting Quality Analysis

</h3>
<ul>
<li>The accounting quality is supported by the use of Ind AS and consistent application of accounting policies. The unmodified audit opinion reinforces this.</li>
<li>Significant estimations are involved in revenue recognition for fixed-price contracts, determination of fair value for certain financial instruments, and employee stock option valuations.</li>
<li>The use of the percentage-of-completion method for revenue recognition introduces inherent estimation uncertainty.</li>
<li>The Company maintains detailed documentation and uses external valuation experts for key estimates, enhancing the reliability of financial reporting.</li>

  Regulatory Risk Assessment
  <a class="anchor" href="#regulatory-risk-assessment">#</a>
</h3>
<ul>
<li>The Company is subject to risks associated with changes in tax laws and regulations, particularly in India and the United States, as well as other jurisdictions where it operates.</li>
<li>The remark regarding the third-party maintained accounting software represents a minor area where complete assurance on the audit trail feature could not be provided, representing a potential, though not necessarily material, control limitation.</li>
<li>The outstanding legal disputes, primarily tax-related, pose a potential regulatory risk, though the Company believes the likelihood of adverse outcomes is low.</li>
