  <meta property="og:description" content="Overview # Detailed Analysis # This analysis looks into the Granules India Limited Annual Report for FY 2023-24, examining its financial performance, business segments, risk management, and ESG initiatives.
I. Financial Performance:
FY 2023-24 presented mixed results for Granules India. While revenue remained relatively flat compared to FY 2022-23 (₹45,064 million vs ₹45,119 million), the company demonstrated resilience amidst challenges. Key financial highlights include:
Revenue: Essentially flat year-over-year (YoY), impacted by a cyber incident and a decline in Paracetamol API sales. However, a strategic shift towards higher-value formulations mitigated the overall impact. EBITDA: Decreased YoY from ₹9,138 million to ₹8,560 million (19.0% margin vs 20.3% margin). This reduction is partly attributed to increased R&amp;D expenditure. Operating Cash Flow: Significantly lower YoY (₹4,394 million vs ₹7,387 million), primarily due to reduced EBITDA and extended inventory days. Net Debt: Increased marginally by ₹750 million to ₹8,421 million. Capital expenditures of ₹3,788 million, mainly in Granules Life Sciences and Granules CZRO, contributed to this increase. R&amp;D Expenditure: Increased significantly YoY (₹1,986 million or 4.4% of revenue vs ₹1,164 million or 2.6% of revenue), demonstrating a commitment to future growth through innovation. ROCE: 16.50%, indicating a moderate return on capital employed. II. Business Segments:">

<p>This analysis looks into the Granules India Limited Annual Report for FY 2023-24, examining its financial performance, business segments, risk management, and ESG initiatives.</p>
<p><strong>I. Financial Performance:</strong></p>
<p>FY 2023-24 presented mixed results for Granules India. While revenue remained relatively flat compared to FY 2022-23 (₹45,064 million vs ₹45,119 million), the company demonstrated resilience amidst challenges.  Key financial highlights include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Revenue:</strong>  Essentially flat year-over-year (YoY), impacted by a cyber incident and a decline in Paracetamol API sales.  However, a strategic shift towards higher-value formulations mitigated the overall impact.</li>
<li><strong>EBITDA:</strong> Decreased YoY from ₹9,138 million to ₹8,560 million (19.0% margin vs 20.3% margin). This reduction is partly attributed to increased R&amp;D expenditure.</li>
<li><strong>Operating Cash Flow:</strong>  Significantly lower YoY (₹4,394 million vs ₹7,387 million), primarily due to reduced EBITDA and extended inventory days.</li>
<li><strong>Net Debt:</strong> Increased marginally by ₹750 million to ₹8,421 million.  Capital expenditures of ₹3,788 million, mainly in Granules Life Sciences and Granules CZRO, contributed to this increase.</li>
<li><strong>R&amp;D Expenditure:</strong> Increased significantly YoY (₹1,986 million or 4.4% of revenue vs ₹1,164 million or 2.6% of revenue), demonstrating a commitment to future growth through innovation.</li>
<li><strong>ROCE:</strong> 16.50%, indicating a moderate return on capital employed.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>II. Business Segments:</strong></p>
<p>Granules operates across three interconnected segments:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs):</strong>  This segment, though facing challenges with Paracetamol API sales (due to higher customer inventory and price erosion), remains a core component.  It contributes 22% of revenue and focuses on high-volume, cost-effective manufacturing.  The company is expanding its API portfolio beyond legacy products.</li>
<li><strong>Pharmaceutical Formulation Intermediates (PFIs):</strong> This innovative segment provides pre-formulation intermediates, streamlining manufacturing processes for finished dosage manufacturers.  It contributed 14% to revenue in FY 23-24.  The company is focused on identifying and scaling up PFIs for molecules with sustainable market presence.</li>
<li><strong>Finished Dosages (FDs):</strong> This is Granules&rsquo; fastest-growing and most significant segment, contributing a substantial 64% to revenue in FY 23-24 (up from 50% in FY 22-23).  The segment focuses on high-value formulations, including complex products and controlled substances.  A new facility at Genome Valley significantly increases capacity.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>III. Risk Management:</strong></p>
<p>The annual report highlights a robust enterprise risk management (ERM) framework, aligning with ISO 31000:2018 and COSO 2017.  Key risks identified include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Regulatory and Compliance Risks:</strong>  Maintaining compliance with stringent quality standards and regulatory requirements across various global markets.</li>
<li><strong>Health and Safety Risks:</strong>  Minimizing workplace hazards and promoting a strong safety culture.</li>
<li><strong>Cybersecurity Risks:</strong>  Mitigating the risk of cyberattacks, data breaches, and ensuring data protection and privacy.  The report specifically discusses the impact of a significant cyber incident in May 2023.</li>
<li><strong>Talent Acquisition and Retention:</strong>  Attracting and retaining a skilled workforce to support business growth.</li>
<li><strong>Sustainability and ESG Risks:</strong>  Meeting stakeholder expectations and achieving net-zero emissions by 2050, managing climate change risks (physical and transitional).</li>
<li><strong>Geopolitical Risks:</strong>  Potential disruptions due to global events (e.g., the Red Sea Crisis).</li>
</ul>
<p>The company&rsquo;s response to these risks involves implementing detailed mitigation strategies, including strengthened cybersecurity measures, robust EHS management systems, a focus on employee engagement and training, and a detailed Net Zero roadmap.</p>
<p><strong>IV. ESG Initiatives:</strong></p>
<p>Granules India emphasizes its commitment to &ldquo;Healing lives responsibly through pioneering green science.&rdquo;  Key ESG initiatives include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Net Zero Emissions by 2050:</strong>  The company has committed to SBTi&rsquo;s 1.5°C pathway, conducted a detailed Scope 3 emissions assessment, and developed a Net Zero roadmap.  Actions include increasing renewable energy usage, implementing efficiency measures, pursuing biofuels, and engaging suppliers on sustainability.</li>
<li><strong>Granules CZRO:</strong> A subsidiary focused on complete supply chain decarbonization through green energy and green molecule platforms.</li>
<li><strong>Green Chemistry Initiatives:</strong>  Investing in biocatalysis and continuous manufacturing to reduce environmental impact.</li>
<li><strong>Water Management:</strong>  Implementing measures to reduce water intensity and improve water stewardship.</li>
<li><strong>Waste Management:</strong>  Minimizing waste generation, maximizing recycling and reuse, and reducing waste sent to landfills.</li>
<li><strong>Employee Well-being:</strong>  Initiatives focused on employee health, safety, training, development, and diversity &amp; inclusion.</li>
<li><strong>Community Engagement:</strong>  Programs supporting education, healthcare, and community development, including Pharma Pathshala and a dialysis center.</li>
</ul>
<p>Granules has received many awards recognizing its sustainability e/fforts (e.g., Economic Times Pharma Award for Excellence in Contribution Towards Sustainability, IGBC Green Crusader Award).  However, the report also notes areas for improvement, demonstrating a commitment to continuous improvement.</p>
<p><strong>V. Overall Assessment:</strong></p>
<p>Granules India Limited&rsquo;s 2023-24 annual report showcases a company navigating a challenging environment while emphasizing long-term strategic goals. The shift towards higher-value formulations and increased R&amp;D investments are positive indicators. The company&rsquo;s proactive approach to risk management and its robust sustainability agenda are commendable.  However, the impact of the cyber incident and the need for continued focus on margin improvement should be carefully considered. The company&rsquo;s progress toward its ambitious Net Zero targets will be a key factor in its future success.  Further analysis of specific data points and comparison with industry benchmarks would provide a more detailed and precise evaluation.</p>

<p>The provided annual report gives slightly different figures for standalone and consolidated financial statements.  Here&rsquo;s a breakdown of the requested values for both:</p>
<p><strong>I. Standalone Financial Statements:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Total Assets:</strong> ₹50,056.27 million</li>
<li><strong>Current Assets:</strong> ₹26,339.22 million</li>
<li><strong>Cash and Cash Equivalents:</strong> ₹2,230.79 million</li>
<li><strong>Accounts Receivable (Trade Receivables):</strong> ₹16,331.88 million</li>
<li><strong>Inventories:</strong> ₹5,786.15 million</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>II. Consolidated Financial Statements:</strong></p>

<li><strong>Cash and Cash Equivalents:</strong> ₹3,811.00 million</li>
<li><strong>Accounts Receivable (Trade Receivables):</strong> ₹9,858.33 million</li>
<li><strong>Inventories:</strong> ₹13,005.45 million</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Note:</strong>  These figures are in Indian Rupees (₹) millions.

Always refer to the original report for the most accurate and complete data.</p>
<h3 class="heading" id="liability-analysis">
  Liability Analysis
  <a class="anchor" href="#liability-analysis">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Similar to the assets, the liability figures also differ between the standalone and consolidated financial statements. Here&rsquo;s the breakdown:</p>
<p><strong>I. Standalone Financial Statements:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Total Liabilities:</strong> ₹18,946.80 million</li>
<li><strong>Current Liabilities:</strong> ₹17,685.50 million</li>
<li><strong>Long-Term Debt:</strong> ₹500.08 million  (Note:  This only includes the non-current portion.  The current portion of long-term debt is included in current liabilities.)</li>
<li><strong>Accounts Payable (Trade Payables):</strong> ₹6,546.32 million</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>II. Consolidated Financial Statements:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Total Liabilities:</strong> ₹22,954.38 million</li>
<li><strong>Current Liabilities:</strong> ₹20,822.93 million</li>

<li><strong>Accounts Payable (Trade Payables):</strong> ₹7,495.26 million</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Note:</strong> These figures are in Indian Rupees (₹) millions.  The report provides more detailed breakdowns of liabilities within the notes to the financial statements. Always consult the original report for the most precise and complete data.  Also note that the &ldquo;Long-Term Debt&rdquo; figures represent only the <em>non-current</em> portion; the current maturities of long-term debt are included within the current liabilities section.</p>
<h3 class="heading" id="equity-analysis">
  Equity Analysis
  <a class="anchor" href="#equity-analysis">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Again, the values for shareholders&rsquo; equity, retained earnings, and share capital differ between the standalone and consolidated financial statements.  Here&rsquo;s the breakdown:</p>
<p><strong>I. Standalone Financial Statements:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shareholders&rsquo; Equity:</strong> ₹31,109.47 million</li>
<li><strong>Retained Earnings:</strong> ₹26,082.61 million (as of the end of the current year)</li>
<li><strong>Share Capital:</strong> ₹242.37 million</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>II. Consolidated Financial Statements:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shareholders&rsquo; Equity:</strong> ₹32,255.44 million</li>
<li><strong>Retained Earnings:</strong>  Not explicitly stated as a separate line item in the consolidated statement of changes in equity.  It&rsquo;s included within the broader &ldquo;Other Equity&rdquo; figure.</li>
<li><strong>Share Capital:</strong> ₹242.37 million</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Note:</strong>  All figures are in Indian Rupees (₹) millions.  The consolidated statement of changes in equity doesn&rsquo;t break down retained earnings separately, making it impossible to extract that specific number from the consolidated report alone.  Always refer to the original annual report for the most accurate and detailed information.</p>

<h3 class="heading" id="operating-performance">
  Operating Performance
  <a class="anchor" href="#operating-performance">#</a>
</h3>
<p>The revenue, cost of revenue, gross profit, operating expenses, and operating income figures differ between the standalone and consolidated financial statements.  Here&rsquo;s a comparison:</p>
<p><strong>I. Standalone Financial Statements:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Revenue:</strong> ₹37,608.68 million (This includes both revenue from operations and other income)</li>
<li><strong>Revenue from Operations:</strong> ₹37,550.91 million</li>
<li><strong>Cost of Revenue (Cost of Materials Consumed + Changes in Inventories):</strong> ₹19,069.17 million (₹19,271.24 million - ₹202.07 million)</li>
<li><strong>Gross Profit:</strong> ₹18,481.74 million (₹37,550.91 million - ₹19,069.17 million)</li>
<li><strong>Operating Expenses:</strong> ₹31,255.85 million (Note: This is a calculated figure derived by adding together all reported operating expenses (Employee benefit expenses, Finance costs, Depreciation &amp; Amortization, and Other Expenses) from the Statement of Profit &amp; Loss.</li>
<li><strong>Operating Income:</strong> ₹6,295.06 million (₹37,550.91 million - ₹31,255.85 million)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>II. Consolidated Financial Statements:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Revenue:</strong> ₹45,107.69 million (This includes both revenue from operations and other income)</li>
<li><strong>Revenue from Operations:</strong> ₹45,063.67 million</li>
<li><strong>Cost of Revenue (Cost of Materials Consumed + Changes in Inventories):</strong> ₹23,912.42 million (₹22,082.21 million - ₹1,869.71 million)</li>
<li><strong>Gross Profit:</strong> ₹21,151.25 million (₹45,063.67 million - ₹23,912.42 million)</li>
<li><strong>Operating Expenses:</strong> ₹39,635.40 million (Note: This is a calculated figure; the sum of all reported operating expenses from the consolidated Statement of Profit &amp; Loss.)</li>
<li><strong>Operating Income:</strong> ₹5,428.27 million (₹45,063.67 million - ₹39,635.40 million)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Considerations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rounding:</strong>  All figures are in Indian Rupees (₹) millions and have been rounded to the nearest million for ease of presentation.  Slight discrepancies may arise depending on the level of precision used in calculations from the source data.</li>
<li><strong>Other Income:</strong>  Revenue figures shown above include &ldquo;Other Income&rdquo; as presented in the income statement.  The operating income is calculated from <em>revenue from operations</em> only to provide a consistent measure of core operating performance.</li>
<li><strong>Expense Categorization:</strong>  The categorization of expenses might vary slightly depending on how individual line items are interpreted.  The numbers provided represent my best interpretation based on the provided financial statements.</li>
<li><strong>Source Data:</strong> Always refer back to the original annual report for the most accurate and precise figures.</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember to consult the original report&rsquo;s notes for further details and explanations about line items and accounting treatments.</p>
<h3 class="heading" id="bottom-line-metrics">
  Bottom Line Metrics
  <a class="anchor" href="#bottom-line-metrics">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a comparison of net income, EBITDA, basic EPS, and diluted EPS, differentiating between the standalone and consolidated financial statements:</p>
<p><strong>I. Standalone Financial Statements:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Net Income (Profit for the Year):</strong> ₹4,359.18 million</li>
<li><strong>EBITDA:</strong> ₹8,071.37 million</li>

<li><strong>EBITDA:</strong> ₹8,603.82 million</li>
<li><strong>Basic EPS:</strong> ₹16.73</li>
<li><strong>Diluted EPS:</strong> ₹16.72</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Note:</strong>  All figures are in Indian Rupees (₹) millions except for EPS which is in rupees.  These values are extracted directly from the financial statements.  Always refer back to the original annual report for complete and precise figures.  The slight discrepancies in the calculation might be due to rounding within the original report.</p>
<h3 class="heading" id="cash-flow-components">
  Cash Flow Components
  <a class="anchor" href="#cash-flow-components">#</a>
</h3>
<p>The cash flow data also differs between the standalone and consolidated statements.  Here&rsquo;s the breakdown:</p>
<p><strong>I. Standalone Statement of Cash Flows:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cash Flow from Operating Activities:</strong> ₹3,169.29 million</li>
<li><strong>Cash Flow from Investing Activities:</strong> ₹(3,029.76) million (negative, indicating net cash outflow)</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Cash Flow from Operating Activities:</strong> ₹4,394.14 million</li>
<li><strong>Cash Flow from Investing Activities:</strong> ₹(3,601.60) million (negative, indicating net cash outflow)</li>

</ul>
<p><strong>Important Note:</strong> All figures are in Indian Rupees (₹) millions.  These numbers are directly from the respective cash flow statements in the annual report.  Remember to consult the original report for complete details and any explanatory notes accompanying these figures.  The differences between standalone and consolidated statements reflect the inclusion of subsidiary company activity in the consolidated figures.</p>
<h3 class="heading" id="cash-flow-metrics">
  Cash Flow Metrics
  <a class="anchor" href="#cash-flow-metrics">#</a>
</h3>
<p>The annual report doesn&rsquo;t directly provide a &ldquo;free cash flow&rdquo; calculation.  Free cash flow is a non-GAAP metric, calculated differently by different analysts.  However, we can glean the necessary information to calculate it from the data provided.  The capital expenditure and dividends paid are explicitly stated.</p>
<p><strong>I. Standalone Financial Statements:</strong></p>
