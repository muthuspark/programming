  <meta property="og:description" content="Overview # Detailed Analysis # This analysis looks into the Stylam Industries Limited annual report for FY2023-24, examining its financial performance, business segments, risk factors, and ESG initiatives.
I. Financial Performance:
FY2023-24 showed a mixed bag for Stylam. While profitability metrics improved significantly, revenue declined slightly. This suggests a successful cost optimization and efficiency drive, but also hints at challenges in the external market.
Revenue: Decreased marginally by 4% to ₹914 crore from ₹952 crore in FY2022-23. This dip is attributed to global headwinds including the Russia-Ukraine war, inflation, and tepid demand, impacting both export and domestic sales. EBITDA: Increased significantly by 18% to ₹183 crore from ₹155 crore, demonstrating successful cost management. EBITDA margin improved substantially to 20% from 16%. PAT: Rose by 34% to ₹128 crore from ₹96 crore, highlighting improved profitability despite lower revenue. The PAT margin increased to 14% from 10%. A significant portion of this increase seems due to a reduction in finance costs. Debt: The company achieved a significant milestone by becoming debt-free in FY2024, strengthening its balance sheet and providing greater financial flexibility. Return on Equity (ROE): Decreased to 20% from 23%, potentially influenced by the increased equity due to retained earnings. Return on Capital Employed (ROCE): Remained relatively stable around 30%, indicating efficient capital utilization. Interest Coverage Ratio: Showed dramatic improvement, rising to 66.87 from 16.6, reflecting the debt-free status. Export Performance: Exports remained a major revenue driver, contributing ₹611 crore (67% of total revenue). While overall revenue declined, export sales showed resilience. II. Business Segments:">

<p>This analysis looks into the Stylam Industries Limited annual report for FY2023-24, examining its financial performance, business segments, risk factors, and ESG initiatives.</p>
<p><strong>I. Financial Performance:</strong></p>
<p>FY2023-24 showed a mixed bag for Stylam. While profitability metrics improved significantly, revenue declined slightly.  This suggests a successful cost optimization and efficiency drive, but also hints at challenges in the external market.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Revenue:</strong> Decreased marginally by 4% to ₹914 crore from ₹952 crore in FY2022-23. This dip is attributed to global headwinds including the Russia-Ukraine war, inflation, and tepid demand, impacting both export and domestic sales.</li>
<li><strong>EBITDA:</strong>  Increased significantly by 18% to ₹183 crore from ₹155 crore, demonstrating successful cost management. EBITDA margin improved substantially to 20% from 16%.</li>
<li><strong>PAT:</strong> Rose by 34% to ₹128 crore from ₹96 crore, highlighting improved profitability despite lower revenue.  The PAT margin increased to 14% from 10%.  A significant portion of this increase seems due to a reduction in finance costs.</li>
<li><strong>Debt:</strong> The company achieved a significant milestone by becoming debt-free in FY2024, strengthening its balance sheet and providing greater financial flexibility.</li>
<li><strong>Return on Equity (ROE):</strong>  Decreased to 20% from 23%, potentially influenced by the increased equity due to retained earnings.</li>
<li><strong>Return on Capital Employed (ROCE):</strong> Remained relatively stable around 30%, indicating efficient capital utilization.</li>
<li><strong>Interest Coverage Ratio:</strong> Showed dramatic improvement, rising to 66.87 from 16.6, reflecting the debt-free status.</li>
<li><strong>Export Performance:</strong> Exports remained a major revenue driver, contributing ₹611 crore (67% of total revenue).  While overall revenue declined, export sales showed resilience.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>II. Business Segments:</strong></p>
<p>Stylam&rsquo;s primary business is the manufacturing and sale of decorative laminates and allied products.  Key product categories include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>High-pressure laminates:</strong> Used in furniture, cladding, doors, and partitions.  The report highlights various types including post-forming, performance (ESD, chemical-resistant, fire-retardant), and specialty laminates (digital, synchro, metallic, unicore, flicker, chalkboards, magnetic).</li>
<li><strong>Acrylic solid surfaces (Granex):</strong> Offer a durable, aesthetically pleasing alternative to natural stone.</li>
<li><strong>Compact laminates:</strong> Durable high-pressure laminates for interior and exterior applications, including cubicles, lockers, and exterior cladding.</li>
<li><strong>Panels (new segment):</strong> The company expanded into laminating impregnated paper onto Medium Density Fiber (MDF) panels, indicating diversification efforts.</li>
</ul>
<p>The company&rsquo;s strong global presence, exporting to over 80 countries, positions it well for future growth in various markets.  However, the report highlights a decline in domestic construction, affecting laminate flooring sales, indicating potential vulnerability to regional economic downturns.</p>
<p><strong>III. Risks:</strong></p>
<p>The report acknowledges many significant risk factors:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Geopolitical Instability and Supply Chain Disruptions:</strong> The ongoing conflict in the Red Sea region affects supply chains, impacting the availability and cost of raw materials.  This is a especially pertinent risk given that the Company&rsquo;s export revenue depends largely on reliable global supply chains.</li>
<li><strong>Raw Material Price Volatility:</strong> Fluctuations in the prices of wood and metal directly affect profitability.</li>
<li><strong>Intense Competition:</strong>  The industry is competitive, leading to potential price wars and margin pressures.</li>
<li><strong>Economic Downturn:</strong> The global economic slowdown has directly impacted demand, especially in the construction sector, leading to a decline in sales.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>IV. ESG Initiatives (Environmental, Social, and Governance):</strong></p>
<p>Stylam demonstrates a commitment to ESG principles.  Key initiatives include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Environmental Stewardship:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Energy Efficiency:</strong>  Transitioning to high GCV fuel and gas for boilers and impregnators, optimizing compressed air use, and installing energy-efficient equipment.</li>
<li><strong>Renewable Energy:</strong> Plans for a 2 MW solar power plant and a hot water generator using biomass fuel are mentioned.</li>
<li><strong>Water Conservation:</strong> Rainwater harvesting and water recycling processes.</li>
<li><strong>Waste Management:</strong> Detailed recycling initiatives, including selling waste for recycling and managing e-waste responsibly.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Social Responsibility (CSR):</strong> ₹1.82 crore contributed to various CSR activities, including infrastructure development in schools, healthcare support, setting up old age homes, and supporting sports associations.  Focus is on education, healthcare, care for senior citizens, and combating hunger and malnutrition.</li>
<li><strong>Governance:</strong> Strong corporate governance framework, including independent directors, various board committees (Audit, Nomination &amp; Remuneration, Stakeholder Relationship, CSR, Risk Management), transparent disclosure practices, and compliance with regulations.  The company highlights its commitment to talent management and employee well-being.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>V. Overall Assessment:</strong></p>
<p>Stylam Industries demonstrated resilience in a challenging global environment in FY2023-24. The impressive increase in profitability margins, despite a slight revenue decline, indicates effective cost control and operational efficiency improvements.  Becoming debt-free is a remarkable achievement. However, the company&rsquo;s dependence on exports and vulnerability to global economic fluctuations and supply chain disruptions should be carefully considered.  The commitment to ESG initiatives is commendable and aligns with growing global concerns about sustainability.  Continued focus on innovation and market diversification will be essential for sustained long-term growth.  The expansion into the MDF panel lamination segment could provide opportunities for diversification.  The company&rsquo;s success will depend on its ability to manage its risks effectively and capitalize on market opportunities in a rapidly evolving global landscape.</p>

<p>The figures are in Indian Rupees (INR) in Lakhs (1 Lakh = 100,000), from the <em>standalone</em> financial statements.  Consolidated figures will differ.</p>
<p>Based on the provided annual report:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Revenue:</strong> ₹91,408.25 Lakh (₹9,140,825,000)</li>
<li><strong>Cost of Revenue:</strong>  This isn&rsquo;t explicitly stated as a single line item.  To calculate it, we need to add the <em>Cost of raw materials consumed</em> and the <em>Purchase of Stock in Trade</em>.  This gives us: ₹45,919.56 Lakh + ₹0.04 Lakh = ₹45,919.60 Lakh (₹4,591,960,000).  Note that the change in inventory is <em>not</em> included in cost of revenue.</li>
<li><strong>Gross Profit:</strong>  Revenue - Cost of Revenue = ₹91,408.25 Lakh - ₹45,919.60 Lakh = ₹45,488.65 Lakh (₹4,548,865,000)</li>
<li><strong>Operating Expenses:</strong> This includes employee benefit expenses, depreciation and amortization, and other expenses. Summing these up: ₹7,506.14 Lakh + ₹2,226.47 Lakh + ₹18,152.71 Lakh = ₹27,885.32 Lakh (₹2,788,532,000)</li>
<li><strong>Operating Income (EBIT):</strong> Gross Profit - Operating Expenses = ₹45,488.65 Lakh - ₹27,885.32 Lakh = ₹17,603.33 Lakh (₹1,760,333,000)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Note:</strong> These calculations are based on the information directly provided in the financial statements.  Slight discrepancies might arise due to rounding or the inclusion of minor items not explicitly detailed.  The report doesn&rsquo;t present these key metrics in a summarized manner; this requires calculation from individual line items.</p>

</h3>
<p>The values are in Indian Rupees (INR) in Lakhs (1 Lakh = 100,000),  from the <em>standalone</em> financial statements. Consolidated figures would be different.</p>
<p>Based on the provided annual report:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Net Income (PAT):</strong> ₹1,284.00 Lakh (₹128,400,000)</li>
<li><strong>EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization):</strong> ₹1,833.60 Lakh (₹183,360,000)</li>
<li><strong>Basic EPS:</strong> ₹75.75</li>
<li><strong>Diluted EPS:</strong> ₹75.75</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that the basic and diluted EPS are the same in this case.  These are all year-end figures, and the actual values will fluctuate throughout the year.  The report presents these values directly, so no calculations are needed.</p>

</h3>
<p>The values are in Indian Rupees (INR) in Lakhs (1 Lakh = 100,000), from the <em>standalone</em> statement of cash flows.  Consolidated figures will differ.</p>
<p>Based on the provided annual report:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cash Flow from Operating Activities:</strong> ₹11,292.35 Lakh (₹1,129,235,000)</li>
<li><strong>Cash Flow from Investing Activities:</strong> ₹(2,089.07) Lakh (₹-208,907,000)  -  The negative sign indicates net cash <em>used</em> in investing activities.</li>
<li><strong>Cash Flow from Financing Activities:</strong> ₹(4,677.29) Lakh (₹-467,729,000) - The negative sign indicates net cash <em>used</em> in financing activities.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are net cash flows for the year.  The statement of cash flows provides these values directly; no calculations are required.  Note that the negative cash flows from investing and financing activities are largely offset by the positive operating cash flow.</p>
<h3 class="heading" id="cash-flow-metrics">
  Cash Flow Metrics
  <a class="anchor" href="#cash-flow-metrics">#</a>
</h3>
<p>The figures are in Indian Rupees (INR) in Lakhs (1 Lakh = 100,000), and calculated from the standalone financial statements.  Consolidated figures would differ.  Determining precise free cash flow requires some calculations and assumptions as the report doesn&rsquo;t explicitly state it.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Dividends Paid:</strong> ₹423.70 Lakh (₹42,370,000) - This is stated directly in the report.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Capital Expenditure (CAPEX):</strong> This isn&rsquo;t directly given as a single figure but can be approximated from the &ldquo;Payment for Tangible Assets&rdquo; line in the Statement of Cash Flows.  However, this includes capital work in progress (CWIP), which may not all be CAPEX in a given year.  The cash flow statement shows ₹1,941.40 Lakh (₹194,140,000) in payments for tangible assets.  A more precise CAPEX figure would require further information from the notes to the accounts or other supplementary data not provided.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Free Cash Flow (FCF):</strong>  FCF is typically calculated as Operating Cash Flow - Capital Expenditures.  Using the figures from the standalone statement of cash flows:</p>
<p>FCF ≈ ₹11,292.35 Lakh - ₹1,941.40 Lakh = ₹9,350.95 Lakh (₹935,095,000)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Considerations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The above FCF calculation is an <em>approximation</em>.  A more accurate calculation would require a precise CAPEX number (excluding CWIP that might be capitalized in future years), and potentially adjustments for changes in working capital not already accounted for in operating cash flow.</li>
<li>The report mentions significant investments in new plant and equipment, which would impact the CAPEX number and thus the FCF calculation.  This information is needed for more accurate computation.</li>
</ul>
<p>The provided data gives a reasonable estimate, but isn&rsquo;t fully precise for free cash flow.  Accessing more detailed notes on the statement of cash flows or supplemental information would refine the calculation.</p>

<p>These profitability ratios are calculated from the standalone financial statements, and will differ slightly from consolidated figures.  The calculations are based on values determined in previous responses, so minor discrepancies are possible due to rounding.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Gross Profit Margin:</strong> (Gross Profit / Revenue) * 100 = (₹4,548,865,000 / ₹9,140,825,000) * 100 ≈ 49.8%</p>

<p><strong>Operating Profit Margin (EBIT Margin):</strong> (Operating Income / Revenue) * 100 = (₹1,760,333,000 / ₹9,140,825,000) * 100 ≈ 19.2%</p>

<li>
<p><strong>Net Profit Margin:</strong> (Net Income / Revenue) * 100 = (₹128,400,000 / ₹9,140,825,000) * 100 ≈ 1.4%</p>

<p><strong>Return on Equity (ROE):</strong> (Net Income / Average Shareholders&rsquo; Equity) * 100 = (₹128,400,000 / [(₹5,365,621,000 + ₹4,123,944,000)/2]) * 100 ≈ 2.7%</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Return on Assets (ROA):</strong> (Net Income / Average Total Assets) * 100 = (₹128,400,000 / [(₹6,076,046,000 + ₹5,384,057,000)/2]) * 100 ≈ 2.1%</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Note:</strong>  The ROE and ROA calculations use the <em>average</em> shareholders&rsquo; equity and total assets over the period.  The exact figures for these averages aren&rsquo;t explicitly stated in the report, so the calculation uses the beginning and ending balances to create an approximation.  Also remember these are standalone figures and will vary from consolidated values.  The slight differences from the values reported in the annual report might be because of rounding differences.</p>
<h3 class="heading" id="liquidity-ratios">
  Liquidity Ratios
  <a class="anchor" href="#liquidity-ratios">#</a>
</h3>
<p>These liquidity ratios are calculated from the standalone financial statements.  Consolidated figures would differ.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Current Ratio:</strong> (Current Assets / Current Liabilities) = ₹4,027,714,000 / ₹599,306,000 ≈ 6.72</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Quick Ratio:</strong> [(Current Assets - Inventories) / Current Liabilities] = (₹4,027,714,000 - ₹1,451,201,000) / ₹599,306,000 ≈ 4.30</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cash Ratio:</strong> [(Cash and Cash Equivalents) / Current Liabilities] = ₹110,636,000 / ₹599,306,000 ≈ 0.18</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These ratios provide insights into the company&rsquo;s ability to meet its short-term obligations.  A high current ratio indicates strong liquidity, but a very high ratio might also suggest inefficient use of assets.  The quick ratio is a more stringent measure, excluding inventories which may not be readily convertible to cash. The cash ratio focuses solely on the most liquid assets.  These values are approximations based on the data provided.  The actual figures may show slight variations due to rounding differences in the raw data provided.</p>
<h3 class="heading" id="efficiency-ratios">
  Efficiency Ratios
  <a class="anchor" href="#efficiency-ratios">#</a>
</h3>
<p>These efficiency ratios are calculated from the standalone financial statements; consolidated figures would differ. The calculations use approximations for averages where precise mid-year values aren&rsquo;t provided.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Asset Turnover:</strong> (Revenue / Average Total Assets) = ₹9,140,825,000 / [(₹6,076,046,000 + ₹5,384,057,000) / 2] ≈ 1.50</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Inventory Turnover:</strong> (Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory) = ₹4,591,960,000 / [(₹1,451,201,000 + ₹1,598,244,000) / 2] ≈ 2.98</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Receivables Turnover:</strong> (Revenue / Average Accounts Receivable) = ₹9,140,825,000 / [(₹1,620,752,000 + ₹1,258,483,000) / 2] ≈ 6.40</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Notes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Average Values:</strong>  The calculations use the average of the beginning and ending balances for total assets, inventory, and accounts receivable because precise mid-year values aren&rsquo;t available in the report.  This is a common approximation method.</li>
<li><strong>Cost of Goods Sold (COGS):</strong>  The precise COGS isn&rsquo;t explicitly stated;  the calculation uses the cost of raw materials consumed (adjusted for changes in inventory) and purchase of stock in trade, as a proxy for COGS.</li>
<li><strong>Variations:</strong> There might be slight variations in these ratios compared to what might be reported in a professional financial analysis due to rounding and the approximated average values used in the calculations.</li>
</ul>
<p>These ratios provide insights into how effectively Stylam uses its assets to generate sales.  Higher turnover ratios generally suggest greater efficiency, but there are industry-specific considerations and benchmarks that would be necessary to interpret these numbers meaningfully.</p>
<h3 class="heading" id="leverage-ratios">
  Leverage Ratios
  <a class="anchor" href="#leverage-ratios">#</a>
</h3>
<p>These use ratios are calculated from the standalone financial statements.  Consolidated figures would be different.  The company&rsquo;s debt-free status significantly impacts these ratios.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Debt-to-Equity Ratio:</strong> (Total Debt / Shareholders&rsquo; Equity) = ₹0 / ₹5,365,621,000 = 0.00.  The company is debt-free, so this ratio is zero.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Debt-to-Assets Ratio:</strong> (Total Debt / Total Assets) = ₹0 / ₹6,076,046,000 = 0.00. The company is debt-free, resulting in a zero ratio.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Interest Coverage Ratio:</strong> (Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT) / Interest Expense) = ₹1,760,333,000 / ₹0 = undefined. Since the company has no interest expense due to its debt-free status, this ratio is undefined.  However, the annual report itself provides the value of 66.87 which is calculated using EBITDA instead of EBIT.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Because Stylam is debt-free, the debt-based use ratios are all zero. This significantly reduces financial risk. The high interest coverage ratio (66.87) as reported in the annual report, further reinforces the company&rsquo;s strong financial health.  However, future debt levels should be monitored.</p>

<p>The annual report doesn&rsquo;t directly provide market capitalization, P/E ratio, P/B ratio, or dividend yield. These are market-based metrics that require current market price information and total outstanding shares, which are not included in the provided annual report.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Market Cap:</strong>  This requires the current market price per share multiplied by the total number of outstanding shares.  This information is not in the annual report.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>P/E Ratio (Price-to-Earnings Ratio):</strong> This requires the current market price per share divided by the earnings per share (EPS).  Both the current market price and the EPS from the <em>current</em> year are needed, which are not provided in the annual report.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>P/B Ratio (Price-to-Book Ratio):</strong> This needs the current market price per share divided by the book value per share (Shareholders&rsquo; Equity / Number of Outstanding Shares).  Again, the current market price is missing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dividend Yield:</strong> (Annual Dividend per Share / Current Market Price per Share) * 100.  The annual dividend per share can be calculated from the information provided in the annual report (₹2.5 interim dividend and a potential final dividend to be decided), but the current market price is absent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dividend Payout Ratio:</strong> (Dividends Paid / Net Income) * 100 = (₹42,370,000 / ₹128,400,000) * 100 ≈ 33.0% (Note: This calculation only uses the <em>interim</em> dividend. The final dividend payment isn&rsquo;t yet determined, so this is an incomplete measure.)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, to calculate market-based valuation ratios (market cap, P/E, P/B, dividend yield), one needs real-time stock market data which is not part of this annual report.  Only the dividend payout ratio (based on interim dividend only) can be calculated with the information provided.</p>

<p>The provided annual report does not include ESG ratings from any external rating agencies.  While the report details Stylam&rsquo;s ESG initiatives extensively, it doesn&rsquo;t mention any scores or ratings from organizations like MSCI, Sustainalytics, Refinitiv, or others that provide such assessments.  To find ESG ratings, one would need to consult specialized ESG data providers or search for Stylam&rsquo;s ratings on those agencies&rsquo; websites.</p>
<h3 class="heading" id="esg-initiatives">
  ESG Initiatives
  <a class="anchor" href="#esg-initiatives">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Stylam&rsquo;s annual report details its Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) initiatives, but lacks specific quantitative data in some areas (e.g., precise carbon footprint).  Here&rsquo;s a summary based on the provided information:</p>
<p><strong>I. Environmental Initiatives:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Energy Efficiency:</strong> The company highlights efforts to improve energy efficiency by switching to high GCV fuel and cleaner gas for boilers and impregnators, optimizing compressed air use, and installing energy-efficient equipment.  Specific energy savings or reductions in carbon emissions aren&rsquo;t quantified.</li>
<li><strong>Renewable Energy Adoption:</strong>  Plans to install a 2 MW solar power plant and a biomass-fueled hot water generator are mentioned, but the timeline and impact aren&rsquo;t detailed.  This shows ambition towards renewable energy sources.</li>
<li><strong>Water Conservation:</strong> The company employs rainwater harvesting and water recycling processes to reduce freshwater consumption.  However, water usage data isn&rsquo;t quantified.</li>
<li><strong>Waste Management:</strong>  Stylam has implemented detailed recycling programs. Waste materials from manufacturing are sold for recycling, and e-waste is managed using a buy-back policy.  The report doesn&rsquo;t quantify waste reduction or diversion rates.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>II. Carbon Footprint:</strong></p>
<p>The annual report does <em>not</em> provide a precise carbon footprint measurement.  The company&rsquo;s actions towards energy efficiency and renewable energy suggest an intention to reduce its carbon footprint, but without specific emissions data, any quantitative assessment is not possible.</p>
<p><strong>III. Social Initiatives:</strong></p>
<p>Stylam&rsquo;s Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiatives focus on many key areas:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Education:</strong> Providing resources (furniture, paint, fans, stationery) to primary and high schools.</li>
<li><strong>Healthcare:</strong>  Monetary contributions to healthcare institutions.</li>
<li><strong>Senior Citizen Care:</strong> Supporting old age homes.</li>
<li><strong>Sports Promotion:</strong> Providing financial support to sports associations.</li>
<li><strong>Combating Hunger and Malnutrition:</strong>  Monetary contributions to charitable organizations.</li>
<li><strong>Apprenticeship Training:</strong> Providing support for apprenticeship programs, aligning with the National Apprenticeship Promotion Scheme (NAPS) and Furniture &amp; Fittings Skill Council (FFSC).</li>
</ul>
<p>The report provides a monetary amount of ₹1.82 crore spent on CSR activities, but does not quantify the impact (number of beneficiaries, improvements in education/healthcare quality, etc.).</p>
<p><strong>IV. Governance Practices:</strong></p>
<p>Stylam emphasizes robust corporate governance practices:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Board Composition:</strong> A various Board with independent directors.</li>
<li><strong>Board Committees:</strong> Multiple committees (Audit, Nomination &amp; Remuneration, Stakeholder Relationship, CSR, Risk Management) oversee various aspects of the company&rsquo;s operations.</li>
<li><strong>Compliance:</strong> Adherence to applicable laws, regulations, and accounting standards.</li>
<li><strong>Transparency:</strong>  Open disclosure of financial and non-financial information.</li>
<li><strong>Whistleblower Policy:</strong> A mechanism for employees and stakeholders to raise concerns about wrongdoing.</li>
<li><strong>Code of Conduct:</strong>  Ethical guidelines for employees and business partners.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>V. Sustainability Goals:</strong></p>
<p>The report doesn&rsquo;t explicitly list quantified sustainability goals (e.g., percentage reduction in emissions, water usage, waste generation by a specific year). The management discussion mentions long-term goals related to reducing freshwater consumption, optimizing energy usage, and increasing renewable energy use.</p>
<p><strong>In summary:</strong> Stylam demonstrates a commitment to ESG through various initiatives, but the report is largely qualitative in nature, especially with regards to environmental impact.  Concrete data on carbon emissions, water usage, waste reduction, and CSR impact would significantly improve the assessment of the company&rsquo;s sustainability performance.  The lack of specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) goals also limits a thorough evaluation.</p>

  Audit Information
  <a class="anchor" href="#audit-information">#</a>
</h3>
<p><strong>Auditor&rsquo;s Opinion:</strong></p>
<p>The independent auditor, Mittal Goel &amp; Associates, Chartered Accountants, expressed an unmodified (unqualified) opinion on both the standalone and consolidated financial statements of Stylam Industries Limited for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024.  This means the auditors found the financial statements to be presented fairly in accordance with Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) and other generally accepted accounting principles in India.  The audit report did, however, highlight &ldquo;Revenue Recognition&rdquo; as a Key Audit Matter (KAM), indicating a focus on the company&rsquo;s processes for recognizing revenue and mitigating the risk of misstatement.</p>
<p><strong>Key Accounting Policies:</strong></p>
<p>Several key accounting policies are detailed in the annual report&rsquo;s notes to the financial statements.  Key among these are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Property, Plant, and Equipment (PPE):</strong>  PPE is recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment.  Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets.  Subsequent expenditures are capitalized only when specific criteria are met.</li>
<li><strong>Intangible Assets:</strong>  Intangible assets acquired separately are recorded at cost less accumulated amortization and impairment.  Amortization is done on a straight-line basis over the useful life.</li>
<li><strong>Inventories:</strong>  Inventories are valued at the lower of cost (FIFO method) and net realizable value.  Different valuation methods are used for raw materials, work-in-progress, finished goods, and waste.</li>
<li><strong>Financial Instruments:</strong>  Financial assets are initially recognized at fair value plus transaction costs (except trade receivables without significant financing component).  Financial liabilities are initially recognized at fair value, less transaction costs.  Impairment provisions are made for financial assets based on assessments of default risk and expected cash losses.  The company uses derivative financial instruments for hedging purposes and accounts for those according to Ind AS.</li>
<li><strong>Revenue Recognition:</strong>  Revenue is recognized when the Company satisfies its performance obligations (transfer of control of goods to the customer).  This is generally at the point of shipment or delivery.  Revenue is recorded net of GST and adjustments are made for foreign currency gains/losses on export transactions.</li>
<li><strong>Employee Benefits:</strong>  Short-term employee benefits are expensed as services are provided.  Defined contribution plans are expensed as contributions are made.  Defined benefit plans (gratuity and compensated absences) are accounted for based on actuarial valuations.</li>
<li><strong>Income Taxes:</strong>  The tax expense includes current and deferred tax.  Current tax is measured at the amount expected to be paid or received, and deferred tax reflects temporary differences between carrying amounts and tax bases.</li>
<li><strong>Foreign Currency Transactions:</strong>  Transactions are initially recorded at the exchange rate at the transaction date.  Monetary items are translated at the reporting date&rsquo;s exchange rate, with exchange differences recognized in profit or loss.</li>
<li><strong>Provisions:</strong> Provisions are recognized when the Company has a present obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that the outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, and in respect of which a reliable estimate can be made.  Contingent liabilities are disclosed but not recognized.</li>
<li><strong>Segment Reporting:</strong> The company operates primarily within one segment (&ldquo;Laminates&rdquo;). Detailed segmental financial information isn&rsquo;t provided, as the revenues and gross profits of other segments are below the threshold for separate disclosure.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are the key accounting policies.  The detailed notes to the accounts contain further explanations and specific treatments.  The application of these policies involves judgments and estimations that impact the reported figures.</p>
