<p>This annual report for Hindustan Copper Limited (HCL) for the fiscal year 2023-24 reveals a mixed performance, marked by growth in some areas and challenges in others.  Let&rsquo;s break down the key aspects:</p>
<p><strong>I. Financial Performance:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Revenue:</strong> HCL&rsquo;s revenue showed a modest increase of 1.56% from ₹1660.63 crore in FY2022-23 to ₹1686.51 crore in FY2023-24.  This slight growth is less impressive considering the generally positive global copper market trends.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Profitability:</strong>  Profit Before Tax (PBT) increased by 3.73% to ₹410.43 crore, indicating improved operational efficiency or higher copper prices.  However, Profit After Tax (PAT) remained almost flat at ₹295.41 crore compared to ₹295.31 crore the previous year.  The relatively small increase in PAT despite the PBT rise suggests increased tax burdens or other expenses. Earnings Per Share (EPS) remained virtually unchanged at ₹3.06.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Key Financial Ratios:</strong>  Several ratios show significant year-over-year changes, requiring further investigation:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Inventory Turnover:</strong> A dramatic decrease from 23.6 times to 9.14 times suggests potential issues with inventory management, leading to higher holding costs and potentially obsolete stock.</li>
<li><strong>Trade Receivables Turnover:</strong> A sharp drop from 25.11 times to 12.33 times indicates slower collection of receivables, which could impact cash flow.</li>
<li><strong>Trade Payables Turnover:</strong> A decrease from 7.87 times to 5.55 times signals a lengthening of the payment cycle to suppliers.</li>
<li><strong>Debt-Equity Ratio:</strong>  Increased from 0.08 to 0.11, indicating increased reliance on debt financing, possibly for capital expenditures.  This needs to be analyzed in context with the company&rsquo;s ability to service this debt (Debt Service Coverage Ratio).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Debt:</strong> Total borrowing increased considerably from ₹156.39 crore to ₹222.46 crore.  While this funded significant capital expenditure, the sustainability of this debt level needs careful monitoring.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Capital Expenditure (CAPEX):</strong>  HCL achieved a CAPEX of ₹518.14 crore against a target of ₹350 crore, exceeding expectations. This investment is essential for future growth but contributes to increased debt levels.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Contribution to Exchequer:</strong> The company’s contribution to the exchequer through taxes and royalties increased significantly (₹397.10 crore to ₹463.98 crore), a positive indicator of its economic contribution.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>II. Business Segments:</strong></p>
<p>HCL operates primarily in copper mining and processing, categorized as a single operating segment.  Specific details on ore production and sales are provided:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Ore Production:</strong> Increased significantly, with Malanjkhand Copper Project (MCP) exceeding its target by 6% and Khetri Copper Complex (KCC) achieving 103% of its target. This suggests operational success in these areas.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Metal in Concentrate (MIC) Production:</strong>  Showed an 11% increase compared to the previous year, but underperformed the target, primarily due to disruptions at the Surda mine in Ghatsila.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cathode Production:</strong> Remained suspended due to a business decision to sell copper concentrate directly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Continuous Cast Wire Rod (CCR) Production:</strong> Increased significantly due to third-party tolling.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The dependence on a single segment exposes HCL to considerable risk, highlighting the need for diversification strategies.</p>
<p><strong>III. Risks and Concerns:</strong></p>
<p>The report identifies many critical risks:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Surda Mine Disruption:</strong>  The delayed execution of the Surda mining lease deed significantly impacted MIC production, underscoring the reliance on governmental approvals and potential regulatory hurdles.</li>
<li><strong>Water Shortages and Power Outages (KCC):</strong> These environmental and infrastructural challenges negatively affected production at KCC.</li>
<li><strong>Volatility in Copper Prices:</strong>  HCL&rsquo;s profitability is directly linked to global copper prices. Price fluctuations present a major threat.</li>
<li><strong>Aged Equipment and Technology:</strong>  Outdated equipment and technology may lead to reduced efficiency and higher operating costs, compromising competitiveness.</li>
<li><strong>Funding of expansion projects:</strong>  The significant increase in borrowings to fund CAPEX necessitates careful management to avoid excessive debt.</li>
<li><strong>Contingent Liabilities:</strong>  The report details significant legal and tax disputes which pose a financial risk, although management expresses optimism regarding favorable outcomes.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>IV. ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) Initiatives:</strong></p>
<p>HCL demonstrates commitment to ESG, with many initiatives highlighted:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Renewable Energy:</strong> Commissioning of a 4.5 MWp solar plant at MCP to reduce CO2 emissions and reliance on fossil fuels.</li>
<li><strong>Sustainability:</strong>  Adherence to sustainable development frameworks and various safety awards received.</li>
<li><strong>Waste Management:</strong>  Winning the ASSOCHAM Business Excellence Award for Smart Waste Management.</li>
<li><strong>Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR):</strong>  The report details various CSR activities focused on education, health, and community development, reflecting social responsibility.  The report shows considerable spending on CSR activities, however an Impact Assessment is ongoing and has not yet been completed.</li>
<li><strong>Official Language Implementation:</strong>  Efforts to promote Hindi usage in official work.</li>
<li><strong>Safety:</strong>  Significant emphasis on mine safety, reflected in many awards received, indicating a proactive approach to occupational health and safety.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Overall Assessment:</strong></p>
<p>HCL&rsquo;s annual report presents a mixed picture. While demonstrating growth in certain areas and commitment to ESG, significant operational challenges, especially at the Surda mine, and the heavy reliance on debt financing pose considerable risks.  The underperformance relative to global copper market trends is concerning. The company needs to address inventory management issues, improve receivable collections, and monitor debt levels closely.  Further detail on the impact assessment of CSR activities would improve transparency.  Successfully addressing the Surda mine issue and upgrading its technology are essential for future success.  A clearer strategy for diversification beyond a single business segment would also mitigate risk.</p>

<p>Based on the provided Hindustan Copper Limited (HCL) annual report, here are the values of the requested financial metrics as of March 31, 2024 (in Indian Rupees, in lakhs):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Total Assets:</strong> ₹327001.55 lakh  (₹3,270.02 crore)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Current Assets:</strong> ₹7161.58 lakh + ₹273.04 lakh + ₹22827.24 lakh + ₹13680.81 lakh + ₹13943.32 lakh + ₹801.35 lakh = ₹7161.58 + 273.04 + 22827.24 + 13680.81 + 13943.32 + 801.35 = ₹68,027.34 lakh (₹680.27 crore)  <em>Note:  There may be minor discrepancies due to rounding or differences in how the numbers were calculated from the report&rsquo;s various tables.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cash and Cash Equivalents:</strong> ₹7161.58 lakh (₹71.62 crore)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Accounts Receivable (Trade Receivables):</strong> ₹13680.81 lakh (₹136.81 crore)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Inventory:</strong> ₹22827.24 lakh (₹228.27 crore)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Note:</strong> The values for current assets were calculated by summing up the individual components as listed in the Balance Sheet.  There might be very slight differences due to rounding if one were to calculate this directly from the report&rsquo;s totals.  Always refer to the official report for the most accurate figures.</p>

  Liability Analysis
  <a class="anchor" href="#liability-analysis">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a breakdown of HCL&rsquo;s liabilities as of March 31, 2024, extracted from the consolidated financial statements (amounts in Indian Rupees, in lakhs):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Total Liabilities:</strong> ₹327007.22 - ₹48351.20 - ₹180159.58 = ₹178,496.44 lakh (₹1784.96 crore) <em>Note:  This is calculated by subtracting equity from total assets, as total assets = total liabilities + equity.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Current Liabilities:</strong> ₹14995.84 lakh + ₹9542.62 lakh + ₹8823.88 lakh + ₹17365.66 lakh + ₹4213.89 lakh + ₹928.47 lakh = ₹55,870.36 lakh (₹558.70 crore) <em>Note: Summing up the individual current liability components.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Long-Term Debt (Borrowings):</strong> ₹7249.98 lakh (₹72.50 crore)  <em>Note: This is explicitly stated in Note No. 19</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Accounts Payable (Trade Payables):</strong>  ₹20846.91 lakh (Current) + ₹9542.62 lakh (Current) = ₹30,389.53 lakh (₹303.89 crore) <em>Note: This value sums both the current and non-current trade payables from the notes to the financial statements.</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Note:</strong>  There may be very minor discrepancies between these calculated figures and those directly reported in the annual report due to rounding.  For precise figures, always consult the original financial statement.</p>
<h3 class="heading" id="equity-analysis">

  <a class="anchor" href="#equity-analysis">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Based on the HCL consolidated financial statements as of March 31, 2024 (amounts in Indian Rupees, in lakhs):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Shareholders&rsquo; Equity:</strong> ₹48351.20 lakh + ₹180159.58 lakh = ₹228,510.78 lakh (₹2285.11 crore). <em>Note: This is the sum of equity share capital and other equity.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Retained Earnings:</strong> ₹102,136.27 lakh (₹1021.36 crore). <em>Note: This is explicitly stated in Note No. 18.</em></p>

<p>The HCL consolidated statement of profit and loss for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024, provides the following figures (in Indian Rupees, in lakhs):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Revenue:</strong> ₹177,173.03 lakh (₹1771.73 crore) <em>Note: This includes revenue from operations and other income.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cost of Revenue:</strong> ₹136,098.38 lakh (₹1360.98 crore)  <em>Note: This includes material consumed, changes in inventories, employee benefits expenses, and depreciation &amp; amortization.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Gross Profit:</strong> ₹177,173.03 lakh - ₹136,098.38 lakh = ₹41,074.65 lakh (₹410.75 crore) <em>Note: Calculated by subtracting Cost of Revenue from Revenue.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Operating Expenses:</strong>  This isn&rsquo;t a single line item in the provided statement. To accurately calculate this, we need to deduct the Cost of Revenue from the Total Income, then subtract the Finance Cost, and further deduct any exceptional items.  Therefore, operating expenses for the period is approximately ₹96,915.19 lakh + ₹4236.59 lakh + ₹17487.02 lakh = ₹118,638.80 lakh (₹1186.39 crore). Note: This includes the other manufacturing expenses, Repairs and Maintenance expenses and Administration expenses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Operating Income (EBIT):</strong>  ₹41,074.65 lakh (Gross Profit) - ₹1611.89 lakh (Finance cost) =  ₹39,462.76 lakh (₹394.63 crore) <em>Note:  The calculation assumes that there are no exceptional items impacting operating income.</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Note:</strong>  These calculations are based on the information provided in the report.  There could be minor differences due to rounding. Always refer to the official financial statements for precise numbers.  The calculation of operating expenses involved some interpretation as the report doesn&rsquo;t explicitly list &ldquo;Operating Expenses&rdquo; as a singular line item.</p>

</h3>
<p>Here are the values for net income, EBITDA, basic EPS, and diluted EPS for HCL for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024, from the consolidated financial statements (amounts in Indian Rupees, in lakhs except EPS):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Net Income:</strong> ₹29,530.68 lakh (₹295.31 crore) <em>Note: This is the profit after tax, after accounting for income tax expenses, but before deducting the share of profit/loss of joint ventures.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization):</strong> ₹59,378.92 lakh (₹593.79 crore). <em>This is calculated from the consolidated cash flow statement after adjusting for items like depreciation, interest, and other non-cash expenses.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Basic EPS:</strong> ₹3.05  <em>Note:  This is explicitly stated in the statement of profit and loss.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Diluted EPS:</strong> ₹3.05 <em>Note: This is explicitly stated in the statement of profit and loss.</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Note:</strong>  There might be minor variations compared to the figures directly reported in the annual report due to rounding differences in calculations.  For precise numbers, always refer to the official financial statements.  The net income value is calculated after adjustments considering items like the share of profit of the Joint Venture.</p>

<p>Based on HCL&rsquo;s consolidated cash flow statement for the year ended March 31, 2024 (amounts in Indian Rupees, in lakhs):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Operating Cash Flow:</strong> ₹29,205.83 lakh (₹292.06 crore).  <em>Note: This is the net cash flow from operating activities after accounting for items like changes in working capital.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Investing Cash Flow:</strong> (₹47,573.51) lakh  (-₹475.74 crore). <em>Note: This is net cash <em>used</em> in investing activities, indicating a net outflow.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Financing Cash Flow:</strong> (₹3,864.37) lakh (-₹38.64 crore).  <em>Note: This is net cash <em>used</em> in financing activities, also representing a net outflow.</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Note:</strong> These values are directly from the consolidated cash flow statement provided in the annual report.

<h3 class="heading" id="cash-flow-metrics">
  Cash Flow Metrics
  <a class="anchor" href="#cash-flow-metrics">#</a>
</h3>
<p>To calculate free cash flow, we need to make some adjustments based on the information provided in the annual report.  The report doesn&rsquo;t directly state &ldquo;Free Cash Flow,&rdquo; but we can derive it.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Free Cash Flow (FCF):</strong>  FCF is calculated as Operating Cash Flow minus Capital Expenditures.  Therefore, FCF = ₹29,205.83 lakh - ₹(20,695.78) lakh = ₹8,510.05 lakh (₹85.10 crore). <em>Note that this excludes any significant changes to working capital.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Capital Expenditure (CAPEX):</strong> ₹20,695.78 lakh (₹206.96 crore). <em>This is the purchase of fixed assets as reported in the cash flow statement.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dividends Paid:</strong> ₹8,896.62 lakh (₹88.97 crore). <em>This is explicitly mentioned in the annual report and the Statement of Changes in Equity.</em></p>
</li>

<p><strong>Important Note:</strong>  The calculation of Free Cash Flow here is a simplified version.

  Profitability Ratios
  <a class="anchor" href="#profitability-ratios">#</a>
</h3>
<p>To calculate these profitability ratios for HCL, we&rsquo;ll use figures from the consolidated financial statements.  Remember these are approximations because we are using rounded numbers.  Always refer to the original financial statements for the most accurate results.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Gross Profit Margin:</strong> (Gross Profit / Revenue) * 100 = (₹41074.65 lakh / ₹177173.03 lakh) * 100 = 23.18%</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Operating Profit Margin (EBIT Margin):</strong> (Operating Income / Revenue) * 100 = (₹39462.76 lakh / ₹177173.03 lakh) * 100 = 22.27%</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Net Profit Margin:</strong> (Net Income / Revenue) * 100 = (₹29530.68 lakh / ₹177173.03 lakh) * 100 = 16.67%</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Return on Equity (ROE):</strong> (Net Income / Average Shareholders&rsquo; Equity) * 100. To calculate average shareholders&rsquo; equity, we need the previous year&rsquo;s value. However, we can approximate this by taking the ending balance of other equity of previous year to determine approximate net worth.  Average Shareholders&rsquo; Equity ≈ (₹228,510.78 lakh + ₹159,866.23 lakh)/2 ≈ ₹194,188.50 lakh.  Therefore ROE ≈ (₹29,530.68 lakh / ₹194,188.50 lakh) * 100 ≈ 15.21%. <em>Note this is an approximate calculation because we only have the ending values.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Return on Assets (ROA):</strong> (Net Income / Average Total Assets) * 100.  Similar to ROE, we need the previous year&rsquo;s total assets to calculate the average.  Approximating this by using previous year&rsquo;s total assets of ₹298,527.15 lakh Average Total Assets ≈ (₹327,007.22 lakh + ₹298,527.15 lakh) / 2 ≈ ₹312,767.19 lakh. Therefore ROA ≈ (₹29,530.68 lakh / ₹312,767.19 lakh) * 100 ≈ 9.44%. <em>Note this is also an approximate calculation.</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Note:</strong>  These calculations are estimates.  For precise figures, use the exact values from the financial statements and calculate the average shareholders&rsquo; equity and total assets using both the beginning and ending balances from the appropriate years.</p>
<h3 class="heading" id="liquidity-ratios">
  Liquidity Ratios
  <a class="anchor" href="#liquidity-ratios">#</a>
</h3>
<p>To calculate these liquidity ratios for HCL, we&rsquo;ll use the figures from the consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2024 (amounts in Indian Rupees, in lakhs).  Remember these are approximations due to the use of rounded numbers.  Always refer to the original financial statements for precise values.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Current Ratio:</strong> (Current Assets / Current Liabilities) = ₹68,027.34 lakh / ₹55,870.36 lakh ≈ 1.22</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Quick Ratio (Acid-Test Ratio):</strong> (Current Assets - Inventories) / Current Liabilities = (₹68,027.34 lakh - ₹22,827.24 lakh) / ₹55,870.36 lakh ≈ 0.81</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cash Ratio:</strong> (Cash and Cash Equivalents / Current Liabilities) = ₹7,161.58 lakh / ₹55,870.36 lakh ≈ 0.13</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Note:</strong>  These are approximate calculations.  The precise values will depend on the exact, unrounded figures from the balance sheet.  There&rsquo;s also a potential for slight variance based on how current assets are defined in HCL&rsquo;s reporting practices.  Always check the official report for precise values.</p>
<h3 class="heading" id="efficiency-ratios">
  Efficiency Ratios
  <a class="anchor" href="#efficiency-ratios">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Calculating HCL&rsquo;s efficiency ratios requires data from both the income statement and balance sheet.  We&rsquo;ll use the consolidated figures, but remember that these are approximations due to rounding and the use of year-end balances instead of averages. For the most precise results, consult the original financial statements and use average balances over the fiscal year.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Asset Turnover:</strong> (Revenue / Average Total Assets).  We&rsquo;ll approximate average total assets using the beginning and ending values from the balance sheet.  Average Total Assets ≈ (₹327007.22 lakh + ₹298527.15 lakh)/2 ≈ ₹312,767.19 lakh.  Asset Turnover ≈ ₹177,173.03 lakh / ₹312,767.19 lakh ≈ 0.57</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Inventory Turnover:</strong> (Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory). Average Inventory ≈ (₹22827.24 lakh + ₹11653.27 lakh)/2 ≈ ₹17,240.26 lakh. Inventory Turnover ≈ ₹136098.38 lakh / ₹17,240.26 lakh ≈ 7.90  <em>Note:  Cost of Goods Sold was not directly reported, but we approximate it using the reported Cost of Revenue.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Receivables Turnover:</strong> (Revenue / Average Accounts Receivable).  Again, we&rsquo;ll approximate average accounts receivable using beginning and ending balances (although this is less accurate than using averages across the year). Average Accounts Receivable ≈ (₹13680.81 lakh + ₹6614.62 lakh) / 2 ≈ ₹10,147.72 lakh. Receivables Turnover ≈ ₹177173.03 lakh / ₹10147.72 lakh ≈ 17.46</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Note:</strong>  These are approximate calculations. Using average balances for assets, inventory, and receivables throughout the fiscal year would provide more accurate results.  The inventory and receivables turnover ratios are potentially less reliable due to the use of year-end values and the approximation of the cost of goods sold.  Refer to the official financial statements for precise numbers and a more accurate calculation using average values.</p>
<h3 class="heading" id="leverage-ratios">
  Leverage Ratios
  <a class="anchor" href="#leverage-ratios">#</a>
</h3>
<p>To calculate HCL&rsquo;s use ratios, we&rsquo;ll use data from the consolidated balance sheet and income statement for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024 (amounts in Indian Rupees, in lakhs).  Keep in mind these are approximations because we&rsquo;re using rounded numbers.  For precise results, always use the unrounded figures from the original financial statements.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Debt-to-Equity Ratio:</strong> (Total Debt / Shareholders&rsquo; Equity) = (₹7249.98 lakh + ₹14995.84 lakh + ₹20846.91 lakh + ₹9542.62 lakh + ₹9812.95 lakh + ₹8823.88 lakh) / ₹228,510.78 lakh ≈ 0.32. <em>Note: Total debt is calculated by summing up all the debt components, including both current and non-current.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Debt-to-Assets Ratio:</strong> (Total Debt / Total Assets) = (₹7249.98 lakh + ₹14995.84 lakh + ₹20846.91 lakh + ₹9542.62 lakh + ₹9812.95 lakh + ₹8823.88 lakh) / ₹327,007.22 lakh ≈ 0.22. <em>Note: Total debt is the sum of both short-term and long-term debt.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Interest Coverage Ratio (Times Interest Earned):</strong> (Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT) / Interest Expense).  EBIT was approximately ₹39,462.76 lakh (calculated previously). Interest expense is given as ₹1611.89 lakh in the statement of profit and loss. Therefore the Interest Coverage Ratio ≈ ₹39,462.76 lakh / ₹1611.89 lakh ≈ 24.48 times.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Note:</strong>  These are approximate calculations. The precise values will vary based on the unrounded figures from the original financial statements.  Also note that the calculation of the Interest Coverage Ratio uses the interest expense from the income statement which can vary compared to the interest paid as per the cash flow statement.  Always consult the original financial statements for precise results.</p>

<p>Calculating these market-based ratios requires information beyond what&rsquo;s directly in the annual report. We need the current market price per share and the total number of outstanding shares. The annual report provides the number of outstanding shares but not the current market price.  Therefore, I can only provide the formula and how to calculate these ratios <em>if</em> you can provide the current market price per share.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s assume, for the sake of example, that the current market price per share for HCL is ₹280.  This is only an example and is not necessarily reflective of the actual market price.  You must use the current market price to obtain relevant ratios.</p>
<p>Based on the given information from the annual report (total number of outstanding shares = 967,024,020) and the assumed market price, the calculation would be:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Market Capitalization (Market Cap):</strong> (Number of Outstanding Shares * Current Market Price per Share) = 967,024,020 shares * ₹280/share ≈ ₹270,766,725,600  (₹2707.67 crore)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Price-to-Earnings Ratio (P/E Ratio):</strong> (Current Market Price per Share / Earnings Per Share) = ₹280 / ₹3.05 ≈ 91.80</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Price-to-Book Ratio (P/B Ratio):</strong> (Current Market Price per Share / Book Value per Share). To calculate the book value per share, we need the total shareholders&rsquo; equity and total number of outstanding shares. Book Value per Share =  ₹228,510.78 lakh/967,024,020 shares ≈ ₹236.04/share. Therefore, the P/B Ratio = ₹280/ ₹236.04 ≈ 1.19</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dividend Yield:</strong> (Annual Dividend per Share / Current Market Price per Share) * 100 = (₹0.92 / ₹280) * 100 ≈ 0.33%</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dividend Payout Ratio:</strong> (Total Dividends Paid / Net Income) * 100 = (₹8896.62 lakh / ₹29530.68 lakh) * 100 ≈ 30.12%</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Crucial Note:</strong>  These calculations are based on an <em>assumed</em> market price of ₹280.  You must replace this with the actual current market price to obtain meaningful and relevant results for these market-based ratios.  The calculations also use rounded numbers from the annual report.  Using more precise values will increase the accuracy.  Always use the most up-to-date information available.</p>

  Segment Analysis
  <a class="anchor" href="#segment-analysis">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Hindustan Copper Limited (HCL) presents its business activities within a single operating segment according to the provided annual report. Therefore, a detailed breakdown by segment names, as typically found in diversified companies, isn&rsquo;t applicable.  However, we can analyze the business based on its major activities and geographical locations.</p>
<p><strong>I. Business Activities (Products and Services):</strong></p>
<p>HCL&rsquo;s primary business activity centers around copper mining, processing, and value addition.  Its operations aren&rsquo;t explicitly broken down into separate segments, so the following analysis integrates information across the company&rsquo;s operations:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Key Products:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Metal in Concentrate (MIC):</strong> This is the primary output of HCL&rsquo;s mining operations, representing its core business.  Production increased in FY23-24 but fell short of targets due to operational disruptions.</li>
<li><strong>Copper Cathode:</strong>  Production was suspended during the year to allow direct sale of concentrate instead.</li>
<li><strong>Continuous Cast Wire Rods (CCR):</strong>  Produced primarily through third-party tolling operations at Taloja Copper Project (TCP), representing a secondary revenue stream.  Production showed substantial year-on-year growth.</li>
<li><strong>Other Products:</strong> The company also reports on sales of other products, including scrap metal and by-products from its refining operations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Services:</strong>  While not the primary focus, the company does some tolling operations, where it processes material for third parties, offering processing services.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>II. Revenue, Growth, and Operating Margins:</strong></p>
<p>Precise revenue figures by product are not available. The report provides only aggregate revenue data.  We&rsquo;ve previously calculated the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Total Revenue (FY2023-24):</strong> ₹1771.73 crore (approximately)</li>
<li><strong>Total Revenue (FY2022-23):</strong> ₹1773.21 crore (approximately)</li>
<li><strong>Overall Revenue Growth Rate:</strong> Approximately -0.08% (a slight decrease)</li>
</ul>
<p>Operating margin (EBIT margin) is calculated previously as approximately 22.27%.  Because product-specific revenue and cost data aren&rsquo;t provided, a product-wise operating margin calculation isn&rsquo;t possible.</p>
<p><strong>III. Market Share:</strong></p>
<p>The annual report doesn&rsquo;t provide HCL&rsquo;s precise market share in the Indian copper market.  It only mentions that HCL, Hindalco Industries, and Sterlite Industries are the major players.  Determining HCL&rsquo;s exact market share would require external market research data.</p>
<p><strong>IV. Geographic Presence:</strong></p>
<p>HCL&rsquo;s operations are spread across multiple Indian states:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rajasthan:</strong> Khetri Copper Complex (KCC)</li>
<li><strong>Madhya Pradesh:</strong> Malanjkhand Copper Project (MCP)</li>
<li><strong>Jharkhand:</strong> Indian Copper Complex (ICC)</li>
<li><strong>Maharashtra:</strong> Taloja Copper Project (TCP)</li>
<li><strong>Gujarat:</strong> Gujarat Copper Project (GCP)</li>
</ul>
<p>The report highlights challenges in some locations (e.g., water shortages at KCC, lease issues at Surda mine in Jharkhand).  The geographic diversification, while offering some stability, also exposes HCL to location-specific risks.</p>
<p><strong>In summary:</strong> HCL&rsquo;s business model is not clearly segmented, making a detailed analysis by segment impossible using only the provided annual report.  The primary revenue generator is the mining and processing of copper concentrate, with additional revenue streams coming from CCR tolling operations and other by-products.  Market share and operating margins at the product level are not disclosed. The company&rsquo;s geographic presence includes many Indian states, each posing its own set of operational challenges.</p>

<p><strong>In summary:</strong>  HCL&rsquo;s annual report demonstrates a focus on various ESG initiatives but lacks quantitative data to assess their effectiveness and impact comprehensively. The report highlights the company&rsquo;s commitment to environmental responsibility through renewable energy adoption, water conservation, and sustainable mining practices, and social responsibility through its CSR programs.  The company emphasizes good governance, but quantified details about the sustainability goals and their progress are limited.  A more complete understanding would require accessing the supplementary BRSR document available on the company&rsquo;s website.</p>

<p><strong>Auditor&rsquo;s Opinion:</strong></p>
<p>The independent auditor, M/s. Ghoshal &amp; Ghosal, Chartered Accountants, issued an unqualified opinion on HCL&rsquo;s standalone and consolidated financial statements. This means the auditors believe the statements present a true and fair view of the company&rsquo;s financial position and performance in accordance with Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) and other generally accepted accounting principles in India.  However, the report also includes many emphasis of matters highlighting uncertainties related to legal disputes, lease renewals, ore transport permits, and asset impairments.  These uncertainties do not affect the unqualified opinion but draw attention to potential risks.</p>
<p><strong>Key Accounting Policies:</strong></p>
<p>HCL&rsquo;s key accounting policies, as detailed in the annual report, are consistent with Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS). Key aspects include:</p>

<li><strong>Current/Non-Current Classification:</strong> Assets and liabilities are classified as current or non-current based on criteria defined within Ind AS.</li>
<li><strong>Revenue Recognition:</strong> HCL employs the fair value of consideration received or receivable for revenue recognition.  Specific methods are defined based on product (sales of copper concentrate, sales of services, sale of scraps, etc.), and consistent practices are reported.</li>
<li><strong>Employee Benefits:</strong> Retirement benefit costs (defined contribution and defined benefit plans), termination benefits, and other employee benefits are accounted for according to Ind AS 19.</li>
<li><strong>Borrowing Costs:</strong> Directly attributable borrowing costs are capitalized; others are expensed.</li>
<li><strong>Taxation:</strong>  The report explains the treatment of both current and deferred taxes.</li>

<li><strong>Inventories:</strong>  Inventories are valued at lower of cost and net realizable value, with detailed methods described for different inventory types (raw materials, WIP, finished goods, etc.).</li>
