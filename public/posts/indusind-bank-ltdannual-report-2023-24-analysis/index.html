<li><strong>Severity:</strong> High. Failure here directly impacts long-term growth and profitability.</li>
<li><strong>Likelihood:</strong> Medium. The Bank demonstrates progress, but external factors (economic slowdown, competition) and internal execution challenges exist.</li>
<li><strong>Trend:</strong> Stable. PC-6 strategy is in its first year, showing alignment with objectives, but sustained monitoring is crucial.</li>
<li><strong>Mitigation Strategies:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Diversification of loan book (new asset classes, secured lending).</li>
<li>Focus on granular businesses and reducing concentration on large customers.</li>
<li>Strategic investments in digital initiatives (INDIE, Digital 2.0).</li>
<li>Expansion of branch network and rural presence (BFIL).</li>
<li>Deepening domain expertise (vehicle finance, microfinance, gems &amp; jewelry).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Control Effectiveness:</strong> Moderate. The strategies are well-defined, but success depends on effective implementation and adaptation to market changes. Key performance indicators (KPIs) like retail loan mix (56% vs. 55%-60% target) and retail deposit growth (44% vs. 45%-50% target) show the Bank is near its goals, but still has work to do.</li>
