<li><strong>CO2 Emission Reduction:</strong> Installation of solar streetlights helped reduce CO2 emissions, equivalent to 16.77 tons in the year. The use of 2 EV cars in the carpool has further reduced the carbon footprint. A total of 140 trees were planted, resulting in CO2 sequestration of 2,800 kg.</li>
<li><strong>Water Conservation:</strong> 12% (10,478 KL) of the total 86,727 KL water consumed across key locations was recycled and reused.</li>
