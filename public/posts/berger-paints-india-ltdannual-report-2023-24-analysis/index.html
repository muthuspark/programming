</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Severity:</strong> High. New entrants backed by conglomerates pose a significant threat to market share and profitability (page 43).</li>
<li><strong>Likelihood:</strong> High, given the low per capita paint consumption in India and the multi-decade growth cycle of the country, making the industry attractive to new players (pages 12, 43).</li>
<li><strong>Trend:</strong> Increasing competition. The repainting cycle is declining, which will put more pressure on revenue growth (page 43).</li>
<li><strong>Mitigation Strategies:</strong> Focus on product innovation, network expansion, and value-added services like Express Painting (pages 10, 11, 51). Investment in R&amp;D for differentiated products, especially in the industrial segment.</li>
<li><strong>Control Effectiveness:</strong> Partially effective. The Company reported revenue growth, although at a slower pace, and an increase in EBITDA, as the raw material price moderated.</li>
<li><strong>Potential Financial Impact:</strong> Revenue in FY23-24 grew by 6%, down from historical rates (page 11). Profit After Tax (PAT) margins increased by 181 bps.</li>

<li><strong>Likelihood:</strong> Moderate. Raw material price moderation has reduced operational costs. The risk of counterfeit is always high, but mitigation steps are in place.</li>
<li><strong>Trend:</strong> Stable. The report indicates increased manufacturing capacities.</li>
<li><strong>Mitigation Strategies:</strong> Implementation of anti-counterfeiting measures and dedicated teams to work with authorities, as also new label designs. Digitization of supply chain, warehouse management system, and e-auction for raw materials.</li>
<li><strong>Control Effectiveness:</strong> Moderate. Capacity expansion and digital initiatives are operational, but their full impact is yet to be realized. Cost savings from raw material e-auctions were noted.</li>
<li><strong>Potential Financial Impact:</strong> Loss of sales and profit, lower margins and cost pressure. Raw material price fluctuation is considered a significant factor.</li>

<li><strong>Mitigation Strategies:</strong> Maintaining a healthy balance sheet, strong liquidity ratios, and conservative financial principles. Focus on internal accruals to fund capex.</li>
