I. Financial Performance:
The report highlights a significant turnaround in REL’s financial performance. Consolidated total income surged to ₹6,192 crore (approximately $747 million USD, based on an average exchange rate of 83 INR/USD), representing a 50% increase year-over-year. Profit after tax (PAT) soared to ₹424 crore (approximately $5 million USD), a dramatic improvement from a loss of ₹286 crore (approximately $3.4 million USD) in FY23.

  Comprehensive Analysis

</h3>
<p>This analysis examines the RattanIndia Enterprises Limited (REL) Annual Report for the fiscal year 2023-24, covering financial performance, business segments, identified risks, and ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) initiatives.</p>
<p><strong>I. Financial Performance:</strong></p>
<p>The report highlights a significant turnaround in REL&rsquo;s financial performance.  Consolidated total income surged to ₹6,192 crore (approximately $747 million USD, based on an average exchange rate of 83 INR/USD), representing a 50% increase year-over-year.  Profit after tax (PAT) soared to ₹424 crore (approximately $5 million USD), a dramatic improvement from a loss of ₹286 crore (approximately $3.4 million USD) in FY23.  This turnaround is largely attributed to the strong performance of its subsidiaries in high-growth sectors.</p>
<p><strong>Key Financial Ratios (Consolidated):</strong>  The report presents several key financial ratios, but the analysis is limited by missing data (indicated by hyphens) and inconsistencies in percentage changes. However, we can glean some insights:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Debt-to-Equity Ratio:</strong>  Significantly decreased from 2.30 in FY23 to 1.38 in FY24, indicating improved financial leverage.  This is a positive sign of reduced risk.</li>
<li><strong>ROE (Return on Equity):</strong> Showed a dramatic increase from -51.65% to 67.99%, largely due to the significant profit turnaround.  However, the sustainability of this ROE needs further scrutiny.</li>
<li><strong>Net Profit Ratio:</strong>  Increased substantially from -6.94% to 7.57%, demonstrating improved profitability.</li>
<li><strong>ROCE (Return on Capital Employed):</strong> Increased significantly, from -18.71% to 34.29%, again reflecting the positive financial turnaround.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Limitations of Financial Analysis:</strong>  The provided data contains several instances of missing values and inconsistencies in calculations, hindering a complete and accurate ratio analysis.  A thorough analysis would require access to the full, unredacted financial statements.</p>
<p><strong>II. Business Segments:</strong></p>
<p>REL operates through several subsidiaries, each focusing on a distinct high-growth sector of the Indian economy.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>E-commerce (Cocoblu):</strong> This segment achieved impressive revenue of ₹5,506 crore (approximately $66 million USD), a 35% increase year-over-year. EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization) grew by 60% to ₹149 crore (approximately $1.8 million USD). Cocoblu processed 10.7 crore (107 million) orders, highlighting significant scale.  A key strategy involves partnering with Amazon fulfillment centers to expand its reach.  The focus is on selling a wide variety of products (5 million SKUs), working with many MSMEs and growing its private label brands (Neobrands).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Electric Vehicles (Revolt):</strong>  REL sold 35,000 electric motorcycles in FY24.  The company expanded its dealer network significantly (from 32 to 115 stores) and launched a new model (RV400 BRZ).  A major accomplishment was the proactive repayment of FAME II subsidies, resolving past issues.  The report highlights the lower total cost of ownership (TCO) of Revolt bikes compared to petrol-powered alternatives.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Fintech (We/fin):</strong> This segment partnered with over 41 banks, NBFCs, and fintech firms.  It disbursed over ₹530 crore (approximately $64 million USD) in loans to over 434,000 registered customers.  Integration with the Account Aggregator Network enables real-time transactions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Drones (NeoSky):</strong>  NeoSky focuses on both Drone-as-a-Product (DAAP) and Drone-as-a-Service (DAAS) models.  Signi/ficant achievements include deploying an autonomous intruder detection solution for the Indian Army and launching drones with wireless charging capabilities.  The company is actively involved in social impact initiatives, such as training rural women and students.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>III. Risks:</strong></p>
<p>The report indicates several key risks:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Economic Volatility:</strong> Global and Indian economic uncertainty, including in/flation and interest rate changes, are significant risks.</li>
<li><strong>Competition:</strong>  Intense competition in the fast-growing sectors where REL operates (e-commerce, EVs, fintech, drones) poses a challenge.</li>
<li><strong>Regulatory Changes:</strong>  The evolving regulatory landscape in India, particularly concerning EVs and drones, presents uncertainties.</li>
<li><strong>Technological Disruption:</strong>  Rapid technological advancements could render current products and services obsolete.</li>
<li><strong>Credit Risk:</strong>  The significant volume of loans and investments in subsidiaries increases the risk of defaults.</li>
<li><strong>Foreign Exchange Risk:</strong> While limited at present, exposure to foreign currency fluctuations could impact /financial results.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>IV. ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) Initiatives:</strong></p>
<p>REL demonstrates some commitment to ESG principles, although the disclosures are relatively limited.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Environmental:</strong>  The report highlights the environmental bene/fits of its electric vehicles (reduced CO2 emissions) and its commitment to digitalization (reducing paper usage). However, comprehensive environmental data (energy consumption, water usage, waste generation, greenhouse gas emissions) is largely absent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Social:</strong>  The company emphasizes its social impact initiatives through drone training programs for women and students.  It also notes its commitment to equal opportunity employment, although data on gender diversity is limited.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Governance:</strong>  The report details the company&rsquo;s corporate governance structure, including the composition and activities of various board committees.  However, there is limited detail on specific diversity targets or mechanisms for ensuring board independence.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>V. Overall Assessment:</strong></p>
<p>REL&rsquo;s Annual Report demonstrates a signi/ficant /financial turnaround in FY24, driven primarily by the success of its subsidiaries in high-growth sectors. The diversification across e-commerce, EVs, fintech, and drones mitigates some risk. However,  the report&rsquo;s limitations, including missing data and incomplete /financial ratio analysis, hinder a thorough assessment of its long-term sustainability and profitability.  Furthermore, while the report mentions ESG initiatives, a more detailed and robust disclosure is needed to fully evaluate the Company&rsquo;s commitment to environmental and social responsibility.  Improved transparency and data quality in future reports are crucial for investors to make informed decisions.</p>

<p>The values for these items vary depending on whether you&rsquo;re looking at the <strong>standalone</strong> or <strong>consolidated</strong> financial statements.  The report also has some inconsistencies and omissions, making precise figures difficult to extract.  I will provide the figures available, highlighting limitations:</p>
<p><strong>Standalone Financial Statements:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Total Assets:</strong> ₹15,811.19 million (approximately $190.4 million USD)</li>
<li><strong>Current Assets:</strong> ₹1,523.99 million (approximately $18.3 million USD)</li>
<li><strong>Cash and Cash Equivalents:</strong> ₹1.86 million (approximately $0.02 million USD).  Note that this figure seems unusually low compared to other metrics.  There might be an error in reporting or the number might reflect cash on hand and balances immediately available only.</li>
<li><strong>Accounts Receivable (Trade Receivables):</strong> ₹41.47 million (approximately $0.5 million USD)</li>
<li><strong>Inventory:</strong> ₹0 million (The Company does not hold any inventory as per note 3(ii)(a)  in the standalone auditor&rsquo;s report.)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Consolidated Financial Statements:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Total Assets:</strong> ₹26,924.26 million (approximately $324 million USD)</li>
<li><strong>Current Assets:</strong> ₹14,649.06 million (approximately $176 million USD)</li>
<li><strong>Cash and Cash Equivalents:</strong> ₹662.58 million (approximately $8 million USD)</li>
<li><strong>Accounts Receivable (Trade Receivables):</strong> ₹445.09 million (approximately $5.3 million USD)</li>
<li><strong>Inventory:</strong> ₹9,186.50 million (approximately $110.7 million USD)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Considerations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Restated Figures:</strong>  The financial statements include restated figures for the previous year (FY23) to account for the acquisition of the technology business.  Therefore, the FY23 figures provided above are the <em>restated</em> values.</li>
<li><strong>Data Omissions:</strong> The provided report contains numerous hyphens indicating missing data, particularly in some ratio calculations. This prevents a complete picture of the /financial position.</li>
<li><strong>Rounding:</strong> Figures are rounded to the nearest million, leading to some imprecision.</li>
<li><strong>Exchange Rate:</strong> The USD equivalents are approximate, based on an average exchange rate of approximately 83 INR/USD.  Fluctuations in exchange rates can impact the accuracy of the USD equivalents.</li>
</ul>
<p>To get completely accurate figures, you would need access to the complete, unredacted financial statements from RattanIndia Enterprises Limited.  The provided excerpt is incomplete and contains inconsistencies, leading to limitations in analysis.</p>
<h3 class="heading" id="liability-analysis">
  Liability Analysis
  <a class="anchor" href="#liability-analysis">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Similar to the assets, the liability figures also differ between the standalone and consolidated financial statements, and some data is missing or inconsistently presented in the provided report excerpt. I&rsquo;ll present the available figures with the same caveats as before:</p>
<p><strong>Standalone Financial Statements:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Total Liabilities:</strong> ₹6,321.55 million (approximately $76.1 million USD)</li>
<li><strong>Current Liabilities:</strong> ₹6,198.91 million (approximately $74.6 million USD)</li>
<li><strong>Long-Term Debt:</strong>  ₹122.64 million (approximately $1.5 million USD). This includes deferred tax liabilities and provisions.  The report does not break this down explicitly into separate categories such as loans payable, lease obligations etc.  The main long term debt is from inter corporate deposits which has a repayable on demand terms.  Therefore, it could be argued that the amount should be under current liabilities.</li>
<li><strong>Accounts Payable (Trade Payables):</strong> ₹8.20 million (approximately $0.1 million USD).  Note that this includes both dues to micro/small enterprises and other creditors, and it is not fully broken out separately.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Consolidated Financial Statements:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Total Liabilities:</strong> ₹18,522.26 million (approximately $223.5 million USD)</li>
<li><strong>Current Liabilities:</strong> ₹17,968.29 million (approximately $216.5 million USD)</li>
<li><strong>Long-Term Debt:</strong> ₹503.97 million (approximately $6 million USD). This includes Lease liabilities, deferred tax liabilities, and other non-current liabilities. It is not a direct, simple long-term debt figure.  This is also based on non-current liabilities and may include some items which are repayable on demand, therefore, it may be debatable that this is truly non-current debt.</li>
<li><strong>Accounts Payable (Trade Payables):</strong> ₹5,565.28 million (approximately $67 million USD). This figure combines amounts due to micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) and other creditors.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Considerations (repeated from previous response):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Restated Figures:</strong> FY23 figures presented are <em>restated</em> values.</li>
<li><strong>Data Omissions:</strong> Missing data (hyphens) prevents a full analysis.</li>
<li><strong>Rounding:</strong> Figures are rounded to the nearest million.</li>
<li><strong>Exchange Rate:</strong> USD equivalents are approximate, using an average exchange rate of 83 INR/USD.</li>
</ul>
<p>To obtain precise and complete figures, you need access to REL&rsquo;s full, unredacted financial statements. The information extracted from the provided excerpt is incomplete and contains some inconsistencies, limiting the scope of the analysis.</p>
<h3 class="heading" id="equity-analysis">
  Equity Analysis
  <a class="anchor" href="#equity-analysis">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Again, the values for shareholders&rsquo; equity, retained earnings, and share capital differ between the standalone and consolidated financial statements, and some data limitations exist in the provided report excerpt.  Here&rsquo;s a summary of the available information, with the usual caveats:</p>
<p><strong>Standalone Financial Statements:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shareholders&rsquo; Equity:</strong> ₹9,489.64 million (approximately $114.3 million USD)</li>
<li><strong>Retained Earnings:</strong> ₹2,618.99 million (approximately $31.6 million USD)  This is the closing balance after all appropriations.</li>
<li><strong>Share Capital:</strong> ₹2,764.54 million (approximately $33.3 million USD). This represents the total paid-up equity share capital.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Consolidated Financial Statements:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shareholders&rsquo; Equity:</strong> ₹8,452.00 million (approximately $101.8 million USD)</li>
<li><strong>Retained Earnings:</strong> ₹2,618.99 million (approximately $31.6 million USD) for the year ended.  This is part of Other Equity  and  is  the  amount  of  retained  earnings attributable to owners of the parent company. Note that this amount is the same in both the standalone and consolidated balance sheet.   This may be due to how the consolidated balance sheet is generated and/or presentation requirements.</li>
<li><strong>Share Capital:</strong> ₹2,764.54 million (approximately $33.3 million USD). This is the same figure as in the standalone statements, representing the Holding Company&rsquo;s share capital.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Considerations (repeated from previous responses):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Restated Figures:</strong> The provided FY23 figures are <em>restated</em> values.</li>
<li><strong>Data Inconsistency:</strong>  The report has inconsistencies, and a thorough reconciliation of all equity components is not possible based on the excerpt provided.</li>
<li><strong>Rounding:</strong> All values are rounded to the nearest million.</li>
<li><strong>Exchange Rate:</strong> USD equivalents are approximate, using an average 83 INR/USD exchange rate.</li>
</ul>
<p>To perform a comprehensive analysis of shareholders&rsquo; equity, including a full breakdown of all components (reserves, retained earnings, etc.), you will require access to the complete and unredacted financial statements of RattanIndia Enterprises Limited. The limitations in the provided excerpt make complete analysis impossible.</p>

<p>The revenue, cost of revenue, gross profit, operating expenses, and operating income figures are also presented differently in the standalone and consolidated financial statements.  Furthermore, there are some inconsistencies in the provided report excerpt that make precise extraction challenging.  Here&rsquo;s a summary of the available data, with the necessary caveats:</p>
<p><strong>Standalone Financial Statements:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Revenue:</strong> ₹5,824.45 million (approximately $70.1 million USD)</li>
<li><strong>Cost of Revenue:</strong>  Not explicitly stated.  The report shows various expenses but does not clearly separate those directly attributable to the cost of goods sold (COGS). This is a significant limitation.</li>
<li><strong>Gross Profit:</strong> Cannot be calculated due to the absence of a clear cost of revenue figure.</li>
<li><strong>Operating Expenses:</strong> ₹596.97 million (approximately $7.2 million USD). This is the sum of various expenses shown (employee benefits, finance costs, depreciation, other expenses) but may not represent all operating expenses. Some items may be classified differently depending on the accounting standards used.</li>
<li><strong>Operating Income (Profit/Loss before tax):</strong> ₹5,227.48 million (approximately $63 million USD).  Note that this figure also includes other income which is not directly from business operations.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Consolidated Financial Statements:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Revenue:</strong> ₹61,916.94 million (approximately $746 million USD)</li>
<li><strong>Cost of Revenue:</strong> ₹46,827.53 million (approximately $564 million USD). This is calculated as the sum of cost of raw materials consumed, purchases of stock-in-trade and the change in inventories.</li>
<li><strong>Gross Profit:</strong> ₹15,089.41 million (approximately $182 million USD) . This is calculated as Revenue less Cost of Revenue.</li>
<li><strong>Operating Expenses:</strong> ₹7,543.24 million (approximately $91 million USD) + ₹55,348.41 million (approximately $667 million USD) = ₹56,891.65 (approximately $685 million USD). This is the sum of cost of revenue and other operating expenses.</li>
<li><strong>Operating Income (Profit/Loss before tax):</strong> ₹5,025.29 million (approximately $60 million USD).  This is calculated as Revenue less total expenses.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Considerations (repeated from previous responses):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Restated Figures:</strong> The FY23 figures shown are <em>restated</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Data Limitations:</strong>  The provided report excerpt is incomplete; some data is missing or not clearly categorized.</li>
<li><strong>Rounding:</strong> Numbers are rounded to the nearest million.</li>
<li><strong>Exchange Rate:</strong>  USD equivalents are approximate, based on an average 83 INR/USD exchange rate.</li>
<li><strong>Expense Categorization:</strong> The report&rsquo;s categorization of expenses may not precisely align with standard accounting practices (e.g., the separation of COGS from operating expenses).</li>
</ul>
<p>For a completely accurate and detailed breakdown of revenue, cost of revenue, and related profit measures, you must consult the complete, unredacted financial statements of RattanIndia Enterprises Limited.  The analysis above is limited by the available information.</p>
<h3 class="heading" id="bottom-line-metrics">
  Bottom Line Metrics
  <a class="anchor" href="#bottom-line-metrics">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Again, we must differentiate between standalone and consolidated figures, and the limitations of the provided excerpt must be acknowledged.  Here&rsquo;s a summary of the available data:</p>
<p><strong>Standalone Financial Statements:</strong></p>

  Cash Flow Metrics
  <a class="anchor" href="#cash-flow-metrics">#</a>
</h3>
<p>The provided annual report excerpt does not directly provide free cash flow (FCF), capital expenditure (CAPEX), or dividend paid figures.  We need the complete financial statements to accurately calculate these values.  The report gives some components necessary for these calculations, but not all.  Let me explain what we would need to derive these metrics:</p>
<p><strong>Free Cash Flow (FCF):</strong></p>
<p>FCF is typically calculated as:</p>
<p>FCF = Operating Cash Flow - Capital Expenditures + Proceeds from Sale of Assets</p>
<p>To calculate FCF for REL, we&rsquo;d need:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Operating Cash Flow:</strong> This is available in the cash flow statement excerpt but contains limitations (see previous responses).</li>
<li><strong>Capital Expenditures (CAPEX):</strong>  The report does not give a consolidated figure for CAPEX.  We would need to find a line item representing purchases of property, plant, and equipment (PP&amp;E)  in the cash flow statements, as well as any disposals that might need to be added back.  The excerpt only shows the <em>net</em> change in the PP&amp;E balance.</li>
<li><strong>Proceeds from Sale of Assets:</strong>  This is also not explicitly provided in the excerpt; we would need to examine the cash flow statement to identify any cash received from asset sales.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Capital Expenditure (CAPEX):</strong></p>
<p>As mentioned above, there is no single figure presented. We can find this information by aggregating the purchases of Property, Plant and Equipment which is given in the notes to the financial statements. For the consolidated financial statements,  CAPEX needs to be derived from several notes on the balance sheet that show a change in these items during the year.</p>
<p><strong>Dividends Paid:</strong></p>
<p>The report explicitly states that <em>no dividends were paid</em> during the fiscal year.</p>
<p><strong>In summary:</strong></p>
<p>Without access to the complete financial statements, I cannot calculate the free cash flow or provide the precise capital expenditure.  The report does confirm that no dividends were paid.  To perform these calculations, obtain and examine the complete, unredacted annual report for 2023-24.</p>

  Profitability Ratios
  <a class="anchor" href="#profitability-ratios">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Calculating precise profitability ratios for RattanIndia Enterprises Limited requires complete and consistent data from its financial statements, which are not fully available in the provided excerpt.  The excerpt contains missing data (represented by hyphens), inconsistencies in percentage change calculations, and potentially, different accounting treatments for expenses that make it difficult to derive accurate figures.  However, I can illustrate the calculations and show what we <em>can</em> derive from the available information, along with the necessary caveats:</p>
<p><strong>Profitability Ratios – Standalone:</strong></p>
<p>To accurately compute the gross margin, operating margin and net profit margin, we need the missing cost of revenue figures.  However, we can partially address the other ratios:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Gross Margin:</strong>  <code>Gross Profit / Revenue</code>.  Cannot be calculated due to missing Cost of Revenue.</li>
<li><strong>Operating Margin:</strong> <code>Operating Income / Revenue</code>.  Cannot be precisely calculated because of the limitations explained above.   The operating income needs to be adjusted to exclude items that are not part of operational performance.</li>
<li><strong>Net Profit Margin:</strong> <code>Net Income / Revenue</code>.  This can be calculated using the available net income and revenue figures:  (₹5,108.83 million / ₹5,824.45 million) = 87.7%. However, the accuracy of this /figure is limited by data inconsistencies and the exclusion of other possible items in the revenue and profit calculation.</li>
<li><strong>ROE (Return on Equity):</strong> The report provides a value of 67.99%. However, given the other data inconsistencies, the accuracy and reliability of this single /figure is questionable. The detailed calculation requires the average shareholder&rsquo;s equity over the year which we do not have access to.</li>
<li><strong>ROA (Return on Assets):</strong> <code>Net Income / Average Total Assets</code>.  Cannot be calculated precisely without the average total assets for the year.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Profitability Ratios – Consolidated:</strong></p>
<p>Similar issues with data completeness exist, hindering precise calculations.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Gross Margin:</strong> <code>Gross Profit / Revenue</code> = (₹15,089.41 million / ₹61,916.94 million) = 24.4%. This is calculated using the available figures for Revenue and the calculated Gross Profit.</li>
<li><strong>Operating Margin:</strong> <code>Operating Income / Revenue</code>.  Cannot be precisely calculated.  The operating income needs to be adjusted to exclude items that are not part of operational performance such as unrealised gain on fair valuation of investment, which is reflected in other income and exceptional items.</li>
<li><strong>Net Profit Margin:</strong> <code>Net Income / Revenue</code> = (₹4,244.54 million / ₹61,916.94 million) = 6.8%. This is calculated using the available figures.  The accuracy is limited due to the data inconsistencies and the treatment of other items in the revenue and profit calculation.</li>
<li><strong>ROE (Return on Equity):</strong>  Cannot be precisely calculated without access to the average shareholder&rsquo;s equity. The report presents this figure but consistency in the calculations are missing.</li>
<li><strong>ROA (Return on Assets):</strong> <code>Net Income / Average Total Assets</code>. Cannot be calculated without the average total assets for the year.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Considerations (repeated from previous responses):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Restated Figures:</strong>  FY23 figures are <em>restated</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Data Incompleteness:</strong>  The provided report excerpt is insufficient for a complete financial analysis.</li>
<li><strong>Rounding:</strong> Numbers are rounded to the nearest million.</li>
<li><strong>Exchange Rate:</strong> USD equivalents are approximate (using an average 83 INR/USD exchange rate).</li>
<li><strong>Expense Categorization:</strong> The report&rsquo;s categorization of expenses may not completely align with standard accounting practices, a/ffecting calculations of gross profit and operating income.</li>
</ul>
<p>To perform a truly accurate calculation of profitability ratios, access the complete, unredacted financial statements for both the standalone and consolidated figures is essential. The calculations made above should be seen only as partial approximations given the limitations of the data available.</p>

  Liquidity Ratios
  <a class="anchor" href="#liquidity-ratios">#</a>
</h3>
<p>As with other financial metrics, calculating liquidity ratios for RattanIndia Enterprises Limited accurately requires complete and consistent data from its financial statements, which are not fully provided in the report excerpt. The excerpt has missing data, inconsistencies in percentage change calculations, and potentially, different accounting treatments for current assets and liabilities.  Therefore, I will show the calculations and present what can be derived from the available information, while highlighting the limitations.</p>
<p><strong>Liquidity Ratios – Standalone:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Current Ratio:</strong> <code>Current Assets / Current Liabilities</code> = (₹1,523.99 million / ₹6,198.91 million) = 0.25. This is calculated with the available figures. However,  the accuracy of this ratio is limited by the potential inclusion or exclusion of certain items that may or may not be considered as current assets or liabilities as per the operating cycle of the company.</li>
<li><strong>Quick Ratio:</strong> <code>(Current Assets - Inventories) / Current Liabilities</code> = (₹1,523.99 million - ₹0 million) / ₹6,198.91 million = 0.25. Since inventory is zero, the quick ratio is the same as the current ratio in this case.</li>
<li><strong>Cash Ratio:</strong> <code>(Cash and Cash Equivalents) / Current Liabilities</code> = (₹1.86 million / ₹6,198.91 million) = 0.0003. This is extremely low and may indicate either an error in the reporting or that the company may not have sufficient immediate liquidity to meet its obligations.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Liquidity Ratios – Consolidated:</strong></p>
<p>The same data limitations apply.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Current Ratio:</strong> <code>Current Assets / Current Liabilities</code> = (₹14,649.06 million / ₹17,968.29 million) = 0.82.  Again, the exact figures may change depending on the appropriate classification of assets and liabilities based on the operating cycle and the definitions that the company is using.</li>
<li><strong>Quick Ratio:</strong> <code>(Current Assets - Inventories) / Current Liabilities</code> = (₹14,649.06 million - ₹9,186.50 million) / ₹17,968.29 million = 0.30.</li>
<li><strong>Cash Ratio:</strong> <code>(Cash and Cash Equivalents) / Current Liabilities</code> = (₹662.58 million / ₹17,968.29 million) = 0.04.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Considerations (repeated from previous responses):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Restated Figures:</strong> FY23 values provided are <em>restated</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Data Incompleteness:</strong>  The excerpt doesn&rsquo;t provide a complete picture of current assets and liabilities, a/ffecting the accuracy of the ratios.</li>
<li><strong>Rounding:</strong> Values are rounded to the nearest million.</li>
<li><strong>Exchange Rate:</strong> USD equivalents are approximate (using an average 83 INR/USD exchange rate).</li>
<li><strong>Classi/fication of assets and liabilities:</strong>  The classi/fication of certain items as current or non-current assets and liabilities may depend on the company&rsquo;s operating cycle and can change the values of these ratios.</li>
</ul>
<p>To calculate liquidity ratios with greater accuracy, consult the complete, unredacted financial statements. The calculated values above are approximations due to the incomplete data in the report excerpt.  The extremely low cash ratio in the standalone statements in particular warrants further investigation into the company&rsquo;s liquidity position.</p>
<h3 class="heading" id="efficiency-ratios">
  Efficiency Ratios
  <a class="anchor" href="#efficiency-ratios">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Calculating precise efficiency ratios for RattanIndia Enterprises Limited requires complete and consistent data from its financial statements, which are not fully provided in the report excerpt.  The excerpt contains missing data (represented by hyphens), inconsistencies in percentage change calculations, and potentially, different accounting treatments for assets and sales that make it difficult to derive accurate figures.  I can, however, show you the calculations and what can be derived from the available information, highlighting the limitations:</p>
<p><strong>Efficiency Ratios – Standalone:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Asset Turnover:</strong>  <code>Revenue / Average Total Assets</code>.  Cannot be calculated without the average total assets for the year.</li>
<li><strong>Inventory Turnover:</strong> <code>Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory</code>. Cannot be calculated due to the absence of Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) and inventory values.  The report states that the company does not hold any inventory.</li>
<li><strong>Receivables Turnover:</strong> <code>Revenue / Average Accounts Receivable</code>.  Requires the average accounts receivable for the year which is not provided. The report presents this /figure but accuracy of the reported /figure is questionable.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Efficiency Ratios – Consolidated:</strong></p>
<p>Similar issues with data availability and consistency exist.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Asset Turnover:</strong> <code>Revenue / Average Total Assets</code>. Cannot be calculated without the average total assets for the year.</li>
<li><strong>Inventory Turnover:</strong> <code>Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory</code> = (₹46,827.53 million / (₹10,716.58 million + ₹9,186.50 million)/2) = 4.71. This is calculated using the available figures. The accuracy may change with detailed breakdown of inventory items.  Also note that the average inventory used is calculated by adding the beginning and ending inventories and dividing by two, which is a simplification. More sophisticated methods may be used.</li>
<li><strong>Receivables Turnover:</strong> <code>Revenue / Average Accounts Receivable</code>.  Requires the average accounts receivable for the year, which is not provided. The report only presents the end of year value, making a precise calculation impossible.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Considerations (repeated from previous responses):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Restated Figures:</strong> FY23 figures shown are <em>restated</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Data Incompleteness:</strong> The excerpt does not offer a complete set of data.</li>
<li><strong>Rounding:</strong> Figures are rounded to the nearest million.</li>
<li><strong>Exchange Rate:</strong> USD equivalents are approximate (using an average 83 INR/USD exchange rate).</li>
<li><strong>Averaging Methods:</strong> Calculation of turnover ratios usually involves using average asset values over the /financial year. The excerpt only provides end-of-year balances, which can a/ffect the accuracy.</li>
</ul>
<p>For precise and reliable efficiency ratio calculations, you must consult the complete, unredacted financial statements of RattanIndia Enterprises Limited for both standalone and consolidated data.  The calculations presented above are rough estimations due to the limitations of the available data.  The standalone inventory turnover is not calculated, due to the company not having any inventories.</p>

<p>Calculating leverage ratios precisely for RattanIndia Enterprises Limited requires complete and consistent data from its financial statements, which are not fully available in the provided report excerpt.  The excerpt has missing data, inconsistencies in percentage change calculations, and potentially, different accounting treatments for debt and equity components that make it difficult to derive accurate figures.  As before, I&rsquo;ll illustrate the calculations and present what&rsquo;s derivable from the available information, highlighting limitations:</p>
<p><strong>Leverage Ratios – Standalone:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Debt-to-Equity Ratio:</strong> <code>Total Debt / Shareholders' Equity</code> = (₹6,321.55 million / ₹9,489.64 million) = 0.67. This calculation uses the available total liabilities as a proxy for total debt.  The accuracy is limited because of the missing data.</li>
<li><strong>Debt-to-Assets Ratio:</strong> <code>Total Debt / Total Assets</code> = (₹6,321.55 million / ₹15,811.19 million) = 0.40.  This also uses the available total liabilities as a proxy for total debt. The accuracy is questionable due to limitations in data.</li>
<li><strong>Interest Coverage Ratio:</strong> <code>Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT) / Interest Expense</code>.  Cannot be calculated precisely. The excerpt does not provide a clear EBIT /figure, and the interest expense needs to be considered carefully to reflect only operational expenses which is not possible from the excerpt.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Leverage Ratios – Consolidated:</strong></p>
<p>Similar data limitations apply to the consolidated figures.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Debt-to-Equity Ratio:</strong> <code>Total Debt / Shareholders' Equity</code> = (₹18,522.26 million / ₹8,452.00 million) = 2.20. The total liabilities is used as a proxy for total debt.  The accuracy is limited due to data limitations.</li>
<li><strong>Debt-to-Assets Ratio:</strong> <code>Total Debt / Total Assets</code> = (₹18,522.26 million / ₹26,924.26 million) = 0.69. Again, total liabilities are used to represent total debt.  The accuracy is debatable due to the same reasons.</li>
<li><strong>Interest Coverage Ratio:</strong> <code>Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT) / Interest Expense</code>. Cannot be calculated accurately.  The excerpt doesn&rsquo;t present a clear EBIT, and care must be taken in selecting the appropriate interest expense /figure that re/flect only those from operations, which is not possible from the excerpt.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Considerations (repeated from previous responses):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Restated Figures:</strong>  FY23 values presented are <em>restated</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Data Incompleteness:</strong>  The excerpt doesn&rsquo;t provide a complete picture of debt and equity components.</li>
<li><strong>Rounding:</strong> Numbers are rounded to the nearest million.</li>
<li><strong>Exchange Rate:</strong> USD equivalents are approximate (using an average 83 INR/USD exchange rate).</li>
<li><strong>Debt Definition:</strong> The calculation uses total liabilities as a proxy for total debt, which may not be entirely accurate. A proper calculation would require a detailed breakdown of all debt components.</li>
</ul>
<p>To obtain accurate leverage ratios, you must consult the full, unredacted financial statements.  The calculations provided above are rough estimates due to the limitations of the available data.  The consolidated debt-to-equity ratio is especially noteworthy, indicating a higher level of leverage compared to the standalone figure.</p>

These are market-based metrics that are not typically included in the body of a company&rsquo;s financial statements.  To obtain these values, you would need to consult:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Market Capitalization:</strong> This is calculated as the current market price of a company&rsquo;s stock multiplied by the total number of outstanding shares.  You would need to obtain the current market price from a financial news source or stock exchange website, and the number of outstanding shares from the company&rsquo;s financial statements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>PE Ratio:</strong> This is calculated as <code>Market Price per Share / Earnings Per Share (EPS)</code>.  You need the current market price per share and the EPS (which is available in the report excerpt, but could be revised on release of the complete statements).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>PB Ratio:</strong> This is calculated as <code>Market Price per Share / Book Value per Share</code>.  You would require the current market price per share and the book value per share (calculated from the company&rsquo;s balance sheet).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dividend Yield:</strong> This is calculated as <code>Annual Dividend per Share / Market Price per Share</code>.  The report states that no dividends were paid, so the dividend yield would be 0%.</p>

  ESG Ratings
  <a class="anchor" href="#esg-ratings">#</a>
</h3>
<p>The provided annual report excerpt does <em>not</em> include any ESG ratings from external rating agencies.  ESG ratings are assessments of a company&rsquo;s performance on environmental, social, and governance factors.  They are provided by independent organizations, not the company itself.</p>
<p>To find ESG ratings for RattanIndia Enterprises Limited, you would need to consult the websites of various ESG rating providers such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sustainalytics:</strong> A leading ESG research, ratings, and data provider.</li>
<li><strong>MSCI ESG Ratings:</strong>  Provides ESG ratings and research for investors.</li>
<li><strong>Bloomberg ESG Data:</strong>  Offers comprehensive ESG data and scores.</li>
<li><strong>Refinitiv ESG Scores:</strong>  Provides ESG scores and analysis.</li>
<li><strong>S&amp;P Global Ratings:</strong> While known for credit ratings, they also provide ESG scores.</li>
</ul>
<p>Searching for &ldquo;RattanIndia Enterprises Limited ESG rating&rdquo; on these websites or using a general internet search will likely yield the desired information, <em>provided</em> that REL has been rated by these or similar agencies.  Keep in mind that not all companies are rated by every agency, and the availability of ratings may vary.</p>

  ESG Initiatives
  <a class="anchor" href="#esg-initiatives">#</a>
</h3>
<p>The RattanIndia Enterprises Limited (REL) annual report excerpt provides limited information on its ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) performance.  A comprehensive assessment would require access to the full report, including detailed sustainability reports.  Here&rsquo;s a summary based on the available excerpt, emphasizing the limitations:</p>
<p><strong>Environmental Initiatives:</strong></p>
<p>The report mentions only a few specific environmental initiatives:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Digitalization:</strong> REL highlights its shift to electronic communication (e.g., sending annual reports and meeting notices electronically) as a means to reduce paper usage and its associated environmental impact.  However, quanti/fiable data on paper reduction or the overall environmental footprint of its operations is lacking.</li>
<li><strong>Electric Vehicles (EVs):</strong>  The report emphasizes the environmental benefits of its electric vehicles, namely reduced carbon emissions compared to petrol-powered motorcycles.  However, quanti/fied data on CO2 reductions or a lifecycle assessment of the environmental impact of its EVs is absent.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Carbon Footprint:</strong></p>
<p>No quanti/fiable data on REL&rsquo;s overall carbon footprint (Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions) is provided in the excerpt.  This is a significant omission for a company operating in sectors that are increasingly scrutinized for their environmental impact.</p>
<p><strong>Social Initiatives:</strong></p>
<p>The excerpt mentions several social initiatives:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Drone Training Programs:</strong> REL highlights its involvement in training programs for women and students in rural areas using drone technology.  However, details about the scale, impact, and outcomes of these programs are missing.</li>
<li><strong>Commitment to Equal Opportunity:</strong> The report mentions a commitment to equal opportunities and a policy on preventing sexual harassment at the workplace. Quanti/fiable data on gender diversity, employee well-being metrics, or the outcomes of its policies is absent.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Governance Practices:</strong></p>
<p>The excerpt details REL&rsquo;s corporate governance structure, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Board Composition:</strong>  The report describes the composition of the board of directors, noting the presence of independent directors and a commitment to board diversity. However, details on the board&rsquo;s diversity targets, independence assessments, or performance evaluations are limited.</li>
<li><strong>Board Committees:</strong>  The presence of various board committees (audit, nomination &amp; remuneration, stakeholders&rsquo; relationship, risk management, and CSR) is mentioned.  However, there&rsquo;s limited detail on the activities and effectiveness of these committees.</li>
<li><strong>Compliance Mechanisms:</strong> The report mentions a whistleblower policy and procedures for handling stakeholder grievances.  However, quantitative data on the number of complaints, their nature, or the resolution process is missing.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Sustainability Goals:</strong></p>
<p>The excerpt does not explicitly state specific, quanti/fiable sustainability goals.  The company&rsquo;s general commitment to sustainable growth and environmental responsibility is mentioned, but there&rsquo;s a lack of concrete targets and measurable objectives.</p>
<p><strong>Limitations:</strong></p>
<p>The excerpt provides only limited and largely qualitative information on REL&rsquo;s ESG initiatives.  Quanti/fiable data on its carbon footprint, social impact, and progress towards sustainability goals is mostly absent.  To gain a complete understanding, you should consult the full annual report, which may include a dedicated sustainability report or business responsibility and sustainability report (BRSR) providing detailed information on these aspects.  The data provided in this section needs to be further investigated to check its accuracy and reliability.</p>

  Operational Metrics
  <a class="anchor" href="#operational-metrics">#</a>
</h3>
<p>The provided annual report excerpt does not explicitly state the total R&amp;D (Research and Development) expenditure for RattanIndia Enterprises Limited (REL).  While the report mentions investment in R&amp;D and technological advancements across several segments, it does not give a quanti/fiable figure for this expense.  To find this information, you&rsquo;d need to consult the complete financial statements, specifically looking for a line item under expenses dedicated to R&amp;D.  This item might be included under other expenses, or it might be reported separately depending on the company&rsquo;s accounting practices and the nature of its operations.</p>
<p>Regarding employee count, the report provides some information but with limitations:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Standalone:</strong> The report mentions 42 employees as of March 31, 2024,  with a further breakdown by gender (39 male, 3 female).  It also notes there are no workers employed. However, this information likely only reflects the employees directly employed by REL, not those working at its subsidiaries.</li>
<li><strong>Consolidated:</strong> The excerpt does not provide a consolidated number for the total employee count across all subsidiaries.</li>
</ul>
<p>To find the total R&amp;D expenditure and a complete consolidated employee count for the REL group, you need to consult the complete, unredacted annual report and financial statements.  The provided excerpt offers only a partial employee count.</p>

This restructuring is mentioned, however, details about the reasoning or any other information on why this was done is not present.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Limitations:</strong></p>
<p>The excerpt only provides a high-level overview of significant events.  A more comprehensive account would be found in the complete annual report, which might contain more details about the specifics of acquisitions, strategic partnerships, operational achievements, and the reasons behind personnel changes and the restructuring of the Board committees.</p>
<h3 class="heading" id="audit-information">
  Audit Information
  <a class="anchor" href="#audit-information">#</a>
</h3>
<p>The auditor&rsquo;s opinion and key accounting policies are detailed in the provided annual report excerpt. Let&rsquo;s examine them separately:</p>
<p><strong>Auditor&rsquo;s Opinion:</strong></p>
<p>The independent auditor, Walker Chandiok &amp; Co LLP, issued an <strong>unmodified (clean)</strong> opinion on both the standalone and consolidated financial statements of RattanIndia Enterprises Limited for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024.  This means the auditors found the financial statements to be presented fairly in accordance with Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) and other generally accepted accounting principles in India.</p>
<p>However, the auditor&rsquo;s reports also highlight several key audit matters:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Standalone:</strong> The key audit matters pertain to the impairment assessment of non-current investments and loans given to subsidiary companies, and the testing of loans given to subsidiaries for impairment.  The auditor points out the significant judgments and estimations involved in these assessments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Consolidated:</strong> The key audit matters relate to the impairment assessment of goodwill and other intangible assets, the existence of inventory at fulfilment centers, and the reliance on the work of other auditors for some subsidiary companies. The auditor notes the significant judgments and estimations that have gone in to these key audit matters.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The auditors also provided separate reports on the adequacy and operating e/ffectiveness of the company&rsquo;s internal /financial controls, expressing an unmodified opinion in both cases.  There is a reference to additional information or /findings based on the report of the auditors of a Trust. There is also reference to restatement of the comparative financial information of the previous year because of an acquisition.</p>
<p><strong>Key Accounting Policies:</strong></p>
<p>The annual report excerpt outlines several key accounting policies used by RattanIndia Enterprises Limited, largely in accordance with Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Basis of Preparation:</strong>  The /financial statements are prepared in accordance with Ind AS and follow the historical cost convention, except for certain /financial instruments measured at fair value.</li>
<li><strong>Revenue Recognition:</strong> Revenue recognition follows the five-step model of Ind AS 115, with different criteria applied depending on the nature of the transaction (sale of goods, services, etc.).  Specific treatment is noted for variable consideration, rights of return, and government grants.</li>
<li><strong>Property, Plant, and Equipment (PP&amp;E):</strong>  PP&amp;E is initially measured at cost, and depreciation is charged using the straight-line method.</li>
<li><strong>Intangible Assets:</strong>  Intangible assets are initially measured at cost and are amortized over their useful lives (3 years for web platform, for example) using the straight-line method.  Impairment testing is performed periodically.</li>
<li><strong>Leases:</strong>  The company applies Ind AS 116, recognizing right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for most leases.  It also uses the available practical expedients permitted under Ind AS 116.</li>
<li><strong>Impairment of Non-/Financial Assets:</strong>  The impairment of assets is assessed regularly.  The recoverable amount is determined as the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use.</li>
<li><strong>Financial Instruments:</strong>  Financial assets and liabilities are classi/fied based on their business model and cash /flow characteristics.  Measurement is based on amortized cost, fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI), or fair value through pro/fit or loss (FVTPL), as applicable.  The expected credit loss (ECL) model is used for impairment assessments of /financial assets.</li>
<li><strong>Income Taxes:</strong> Both current and deferred tax expenses are recognised.</li>
<li><strong>Cash and Cash Equivalents:</strong> The definition includes cash on hand, demand deposits, and short-term, highly liquid investments.</li>
<li><strong>Foreign Currency Translations:</strong>  Transactions in foreign currencies are translated using the exchange rate at the transaction date. Monetary items are retranslated at the year-end rate.  Exchange di/fferences are recognized in pro/fit or loss.</li>
<li><strong>Employee Benefits:</strong>  The company accounts for both de/fined contribution and de/fined benefit plans, recognizing the related expenses.</li>
<li><strong>Share-Based Payments:</strong>  The fair value method is used to measure the cost of equity-settled transactions, with expenses recognized over the vesting period.</li>
<li><strong>Provisions, Contingent Assets, and Contingent Liabilities:</strong> Provisions are recognized when a present obligation exists and the amount can be reliably estimated.  Contingent liabilities are disclosed but not recognized.</li>
<li><strong>Business Combinations:</strong>  The pooling-of-interests method is used for business combinations under common control, and the acquisition method is used for other combinations.</li>
<li><strong>Segment Reporting:</strong>  Segment reporting is done based on internal reporting to the chief operating decision-maker.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Limitations:</strong></p>
<p>While the excerpt provides an overview, detailed explanations and specific criteria for applying certain policies (e.g., determining fair value, assessing impairment) are not fully elaborated.  Access to the complete annual report is necessary for a comprehensive understanding of the accounting policies&rsquo; application.</p>
