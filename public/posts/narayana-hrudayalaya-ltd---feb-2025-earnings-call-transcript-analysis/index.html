Integrated Care Strategy: The company is placing significant emphasis on its integrated care model, combining hospitals, clinics, and insurance. The “Arya” insurance plan is seen as a flagship product. Controlled Investment: Management is committed to a disciplined approach to investment, with a focus on maintaining manageable debt levels and controlling the burn rate in new ventures. Long-Term Optimism: Despite near-term challenges and complexities, management expresses long-term optimism about the company’s growth prospects, driven by increasing healthcare demand and its differentiated approach. Debt-EBITDA Ratio: Comfortable with Debt-EBITDA up to 3, expected to be reached by end of fourth year with new projects. Decrease expected as new hospitals generate cash. Download Transcript">
