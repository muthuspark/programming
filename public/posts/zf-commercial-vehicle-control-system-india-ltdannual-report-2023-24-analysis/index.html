</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Severity:</strong> High, due to the potential impact on long-term market position and revenue growth from the reliance on OEMs and specific vehicle segments.</li>
<li><strong>Likelihood:</strong> Medium. The cyclical nature of the commercial vehicle industry and dependence on customer&rsquo;s business objectives pose constant threats.</li>
<li><strong>Trend:</strong> Stable, risks are inherent to the industry but fluctuating based on economic cycles and customer demand.</li>
<li><strong>Mitigation Strategies:</strong> Product portfolio diversification, focusing on aftermarket, and expansion into Autonomous, Connected, and Electric (ACE) solutions.</li>
<li><strong>Control Effectiveness:</strong> Partially effective. New product development and aftermarket focus indicate mitigation efforts.</li>
<li><strong>Potential Financial Impact:</strong> A decrease was seen, with a 9.5% market outperformance. However, a potential negative impact exists if OEM demand drops significantly.</li>

<li><strong>Trend:</strong> Improving. Investments in digitalization and smart automation are increasing.</li>
<li><strong>Mitigation Strategies:</strong> Digital Manufacturing Platform implementation, smart automation, employee training, and &ldquo;Six Lean Principles&rdquo; application.</li>
<li><strong>Control Effectiveness:</strong> Moderately Effective. 45% utilization of renewable energy, 15.2% energy conservation, and TPM Excellence Awards indicate some control.</li>
<li><strong>Potential Financial Impact:</strong> The potential for increased operational costs and inefficiencies is demonstrated by energy consumption and waste generation data.</li>
