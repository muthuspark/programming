  Analysis of Accounting Quality and Regulatory Risk Assessment
  <a class="anchor" href="#analysis-of-accounting-quality-and-regulatory-risk-assessment">#</a>
</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Accounting Quality:</strong> The accounting policies are consistent, and the financial statements provide a true and fair view. The use of actuarial valuations for IBNR and IBNER reserves, and the adoption of the intrinsic value method for ESOS, are noted.</li>
<li><strong>Regulatory Risk Assessment:</strong> Key areas of risk are adequately addressed, including underwriting, credit, and market risks. Compliance with regulations such as those set out by IRDAI, Companies Act 2013, and Listing Regulations are met.</li>
<li>The absence of a fully operational audit trail feature until March 15, 2024, in commission and reinsurance records.</li>
<li>The discontinuation of a key policy and claim administration application without full audit trail preservation poses a risk.</li>
