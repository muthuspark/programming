<li><strong>Accounting Quality:</strong> The use of an unmodified audit opinion and adherence to Ind AS indicates sound accounting quality. Consistent application of accounting policies further supports this. However, the use of judgment in areas like useful lives of assets, impairment, and provisions introduces a degree of subjectivity.</li>
<li><strong>Regulatory Risk:</strong> The most material element is a penalty imposed by the Competition Commission of India. Other than that risk appears at a generally acceptable level with compliance confirmed and the only outstanding issue being normal disputed demands.</li>
