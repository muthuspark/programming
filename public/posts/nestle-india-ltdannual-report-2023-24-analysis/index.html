  Accounting Quality and Regulatory Risk Assessment
  <a class="anchor" href="#accounting-quality-and-regulatory-risk-assessment">#</a>
</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Accounting Quality:</strong> The unqualified audit opinion, compliance with Ind AS, and consistent application of accounting policies suggest a high level of accounting quality. However, the change in the financial year end and the pooling of interest methodology introduce some complexity.</li>
<li><strong>Regulatory Risk:</strong> The company faces ongoing risks from tax disputes. The lack of material findings or penalties related to financial reporting and internal controls, and the presence of a robust risk management framework, indicate a relatively lower regulatory risk in those areas. The change in financial year-end does not impact overall accounting quality.</li>
