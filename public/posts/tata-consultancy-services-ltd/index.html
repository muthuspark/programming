Revenue: ₹240,893 crore (US$ 29.1 billion), a 6.8% YoY growth (3.4% in constant currency). This growth was slower than the previous year (17.6%) due to reduced discretionary spending by clients and completion of some earlier projects.

Net Margin: 19.3% Net Profit: ₹46,099 crore (attributable to shareholders), a 10.5% YoY growth. EPS: ₹127.74, a 10.9% YoY increase.

<p>The provided annual report gives consolidated and standalone figures.  Here&rsquo;s a breakdown of the requested values for both:</p>
<p><strong>Consolidated Financial Statements:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Total Assets:</strong> ₹1,46,449 crore (as of March 31, 2024)</li>
<li><strong>Current Assets:</strong> ₹46,104 crore (as of March 31, 2024)</li>

<li><strong>Unbilled (Current):</strong> ₹9,143 crore (as of March 31, 2024)</li>
<li><strong>Billed (Non-Current):</strong> ₹731 crore (as of March 31, 2024)</li>
<li><strong>Unbilled (Non-Current):</strong> ₹127 crore (as of March 31, 2024)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Inventories:</strong> ₹28 crore (as of March 31, 2024)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Standalone Financial Statements:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Total Assets:</strong> ₹1,21,148 crore (as of March 31, 2024)</li>
<li><strong>Current Assets:</strong> ₹94,918 crore (as of March 31, 2024)</li>
<li><strong>Cash and Cash Equivalents:</strong> ₹3,644 crore (as of March 31, 2024)</li>
<li><strong>Accounts Receivable:</strong> This is split into billed and unbilled:
<ul>
<li><strong>Billed (Current):</strong> ₹38,591 crore (as of March 31, 2024)</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Inventories:</strong> ₹27 crore (as of March 31, 2024)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Note:</strong>  These figures are in Indian Rupees (₹) and are rounded to the nearest crore.  The report also shows comparative figures for March 31, 2023.  The significant difference between standalone and consolidated figures reflects the inclusion of subsidiary companies&rsquo; financial data in the consolidated statements.</p>
<h3 class="heading" id="liability-analysis">
  Liability Analysis
  <a class="anchor" href="#liability-analysis">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Again, the report provides both consolidated and standalone figures. Here&rsquo;s the breakdown of the requested liability values for both:</p>
<p><strong>Consolidated Financial Statements:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Total Liabilities:</strong> ₹74,344 crore (as of March 31, 2024)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Current Liabilities:</strong> ₹46,104 crore (as of March 31, 2024)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Long-Term Debt:</strong> This is not explicitly stated as a single line item.  However, the components of long-term debt are included within &ldquo;Non-Current Liabilities&rdquo;:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Financial Liabilities (long-term):</strong> ₹6,203 crore (as of March 31, 2024)</li>
<li><strong>Lease Liabilities (long-term):</strong> ₹1,564 crore (as of March 31, 2024)</li>
<li><strong>Other Financial Liabilities (long-term):</strong> ₹3,403 crore (as of March 31, 2024)</li>
<li><strong>Unearned and Deferred Revenue (long-term):</strong> ₹365 crore (as of March 31, 2024)  This represents billings received for services not yet delivered.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Accounts Payable:</strong> ₹9,981 crore (as of March 31, 2024). This is broken down further in Note 8(g) by maturity period.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Standalone Financial Statements:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Total Liabilities:</strong> ₹48,727 crore (as of March 31, 2024)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Current Liabilities:</strong> ₹43,061 crore (as of March 31, 2024)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Long-Term Debt:</strong>  Similar to the consolidated statements, long-term debt is not a single line item but is represented by components within &ldquo;Non-Current Liabilities&rdquo;:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lease Liabilities (long-term):</strong> ₹5,128 crore (as of March 31, 2024)</li>
<li><strong>Other Financial Liabilities (long-term):</strong> ₹315 crore (as of March 31, 2024)</li>
<li><strong>Employee Benefit Obligations (long-term):</strong> ₹144 crore (as of March 31, 2024)</li>
<li><strong>Deferred Tax Liabilities (net):</strong> ₹154 crore (as of March 31, 2024)</li>
<li><strong>Unearned and Deferred Revenue (long-term):</strong> ₹226 crore (as of March 31, 2024)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Accounts Payable:</strong>  ₹14,599 crore (as of March 31, 2024). This includes dues to small enterprises and micro enterprises (₹79 crore).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Note:</strong>  These figures are in Indian Rupees (₹) and are rounded to the nearest crore.  The report also shows comparative figures for March 31, 2023. The discrepancies between standalone and consolidated figures arise because the consolidated figures encompass the financial positions of all subsidiary companies.  Also note that &ldquo;long-term debt&rdquo; is inferred from the provided notes as it&rsquo;s not explicitly labeled as such in the balance sheet.  The components listed above are considered long-term based on their stated maturities.</p>
<h3 class="heading" id="equity-analysis">
  Equity Analysis
  <a class="anchor" href="#equity-analysis">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a breakdown of the shareholders&rsquo; equity, retained earnings, and share capital values from both the consolidated and standalone financial statements:</p>
<p><strong>Consolidated Financial Statements:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Total Equity:</strong> ₹91,319 crore (as of March 31, 2024)
<ul>
<li><strong>Equity attributable to shareholders of the Company:</strong> ₹90,127 crore (as of March 31, 2024). This includes:
<ul>
<li><strong>Share Capital:</strong> ₹362 crore (as of March 31, 2024)</li>
<li><strong>Retained Earnings:</strong> ₹70,033 crore (as of March 31, 2024).  Note that this value includes many other equity components (Capital Reserve, Capital Redemption Reserve, Special Economic Zone Re-investment Reserve, Investment Revaluation Reserve, Cash Flow Hedging Reserve, Foreign Currency Translation Reserve).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Non-controlling Interests:</strong> ₹1,192 crore (as of March 31, 2024)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Standalone Financial Statements:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Total Equity:</strong> ₹72,120 crore (as of March 31, 2024)
<ul>
<li><strong>Share Capital:</strong> ₹362 crore (as of March 31, 2024)</li>
<li><strong>Retained Earnings:</strong> ₹55,173 crore (as of March 31, 2024).  Note that similar to the consolidated statement, this value comprises retained earnings and many other equity components (Capital Reserve, Capital Redemption Reserve, Special Economic Zone Re-investment Reserve, Investment Revaluation Reserve, Cash Flow Hedging Reserve).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Notes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>All values are in Indian Rupees (₹) and rounded to the nearest crore.</li>
<li>The standalone figures represent only TCS Limited&rsquo;s equity, while the consolidated figures include the equity of all subsidiaries.</li>
<li>The &ldquo;Retained Earnings&rdquo; figures shown above are simplified representations. The actual &ldquo;Retained Earnings&rdquo; line item in the financial statements is adjusted to include other detailed income. The detailed breakdown of these other equity components is available in Note 11 (Consolidated) and Note 9 (Standalone) of their respective financial statements.  These components represent various adjustments and reserves, not just accumulated profits.</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, for a precise understanding of the various reserve components, careful review of Notes 11 and 9, as mentioned above, are crucial.</p>

</h3>
<p>The annual report provides both standalone and consolidated figures.  Here&rsquo;s the breakdown of the requested income statement values, for both:</p>
<p><strong>Consolidated Financial Statements:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Revenue:</strong> ₹240,893 crore (Year ended March 31, 2024)</li>
<li><strong>Cost of Revenue:</strong>  The report does not explicitly separate &ldquo;Cost of Revenue&rdquo; as a line item.  Instead, it presents &ldquo;Employee benefit expenses&rdquo; and &ldquo;Other expenses&rdquo; as the primary cost categories.  These, along with depreciation and amortization, are typically considered cost of services for an IT services company.  Therefore:
<ul>
<li><strong>Employee Benefit Expenses:</strong> ₹140,131 crore</li>
<li><strong>Other Expenses:</strong> ₹32,764 crore (Excluding Depreciation and Amortization)</li>
<li><strong>Depreciation &amp; Amortization:</strong> ₹4,985 crore</li>
<li><strong>Total Cost of Services (inferred):</strong> ₹177,880 crore (₹140,131 + ₹32,764 + ₹4,985)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Gross Profit (inferred):</strong> ₹62,013 crore (₹240,893 - ₹177,880)</li>
<li><strong>Operating Expenses:</strong>  ₹177,880 crore (as calculated above)  This includes Employee benefits expense, cost of equipment and software licences, finance costs, depreciation and amortization and other expenses.</li>
<li><strong>Operating Income:</strong> ₹63,013 crore (₹240,893 - ₹177,880)  (This differs slightly from EBIT due to how certain items are reported.)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Standalone Financial Statements:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Revenue:</strong> ₹202,359 crore (Year ended March 31, 2024)</li>
<li><strong>Cost of Revenue:</strong> Similar to the consolidated statement, a separate &ldquo;Cost of Revenue&rdquo; line item isn&rsquo;t explicitly provided.  Instead, we can infer it:

  Cash Flow Components
  <a class="anchor" href="#cash-flow-components">#</a>
</h3>
<p>The annual report provides both consolidated and standalone cash flow statements. Here&rsquo;s a summary of the operating, investing, and financing cash flows for both:</p>
<p><strong>Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cash Flows from Operating Activities:</strong> ₹44,338 crore (Year ended March 31, 2024)</li>
<li><strong>Cash Flows from Investing Activities:</strong> ₹10,807 crore (Year ended March 31, 2024)</li>
<li><strong>Cash Flows from Financing Activities:</strong> ₹(48,536) crore (Year ended March 31, 2024)  The negative sign indicates a net cash outflow.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Standalone Statement of Cash Flows:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cash Flows from Operating Activities:</strong> ₹39,142 crore (Year ended March 31, 2024)</li>
<li><strong>Cash Flows from Investing Activities:</strong> ₹10,807 crore (Year ended March 31, 2024)</li>
<li><strong>Cash Flows from Financing Activities:</strong> ₹(47,793) crore (Year ended March 31, 2024).  The negative sign indicates a net cash outflow.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Notes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>All figures are in Indian Rupees (₹) and are rounded to the nearest crore.</li>
<li>The standalone statement reflects only the cash flows of TCS Limited, while the consolidated statement includes the cash flows of all its subsidiaries.  The substantial difference in financing cash flows between the standalone and consolidated statements is primarily due to the consolidated statement reflecting the activities of subsidiaries. The large negative cash flow from financing activities in both statements is mainly due to significant dividend payouts and share buyback.</li>
<li>For precise details including the individual components of each cash flow category, refer to the respective statements within the full annual report.  The provided text transcription contains summarized values only.</li>

  <a class="anchor" href="#cash-flow-metrics">#</a>
</h3>
<p>The annual report doesn&rsquo;t directly provide a single line item for &ldquo;Free Cash Flow.&rdquo; However, we can calculate it and find the other values you requested using the information provided in the cash flow statements and notes:</p>
<p><strong>Consolidated Financial Statements:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Free Cash Flow (Calculated):</strong> To calculate free cash flow, we subtract Capital Expenditure from Cash Flow from Operating Activities.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cash Flow from Operating Activities:</strong> ₹44,338 crore</li>
<li><strong>Capital Expenditure:</strong>  This is not explicitly stated as a single figure, but can be derived from investing activities: ₹(1,720) crore for property, plant, and equipment; ₹(17) crore for right-of-use assets; ₹(442) crore for intangible assets.  The total is approximately ₹(2,179) crore.  (Note:  This assumes that all investing activity is Capital Expenditure.  It might exclude some items.)</li>
<li><strong>Free Cash Flow (Calculated):</strong> ₹46,517 crore (₹44,338 - ₹(2,179))</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Capital Expenditure (CAPEX) (Inferred):</strong> Approximately ₹(2,179) crore (as calculated above).  This is not a directly stated value.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dividends Paid:</strong> ₹25,137 crore (Year ended March 31, 2024)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Standalone Financial Statements:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Free Cash Flow (Calculated):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cash Flow from Operating Activities:</strong> ₹39,142 crore</li>
<li><strong>Capital Expenditure (Inferred):</strong>  Similar to the consolidated statement, this is not a single line item but can be approximated from investing activities: ₹(1,720) crore.  Other significant investing activities are likely not CAPEX.</li>
<li><strong>Free Cash Flow (Calculated):</strong> ₹37,422 crore (₹39,142 - ₹(1,720))</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Capital Expenditure (CAPEX) (Inferred):</strong> Approximately ₹(1,720) crore (as calculated above)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dividends Paid:</strong> ₹25,137 crore (Year ended March 31, 2024)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Notes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>All values are in Indian Rupees (₹) and rounded to the nearest crore.  Free Cash Flow is a calculated value.  The precise calculation might differ depending on how certain items are classified in the original financial statements.</li>
<li>The standalone figures relate only to TCS Limited, while the consolidated figures include all subsidiaries.</li>
<li>The &lsquo;Capital Expenditure&rsquo; values are inferred from the cash flow statements&rsquo; investing activities section. Other cash outflows related to investments might not be considered as CAPEX (e.g., proceeds from disposal of investments).  The precise number for CAPEX needs to be verified from the notes to the financial statements of the company.  The number mentioned here could thus be slightly different than the certified value of CAPEX.</li>
</ul>
<p>To obtain completely accurate figures, a direct review of the cash flow statements and related notes within the original annual report is highly recommended.</p>

  Profitability Ratios
  <a class="anchor" href="#profitability-ratios">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Calculating precise profitability ratios requires the exact figures from the certified financial statements.  While the report provides some key margin figures, others need calculation.  Also, remember that the report provides both standalone and consolidated numbers.  Here&rsquo;s what we can infer, with the important caveat that these are <em>approximations</em> based on the data provided in the transcription:</p>
<p><strong>Consolidated Financial Statements:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Revenue:</strong> ₹240,893 crore</li>
<li><strong>Gross Profit (Inferred):</strong> ₹62,013 crore (This is calculated by subtracting the inferred cost of services from Revenue)</li>
<li><strong>Gross Margin (Inferred):</strong> 25.7% (₹62,013 crore / ₹240,893 crore)</li>
<li><strong>Operating Margin:</strong> 24.6% (This is explicitly stated in the report)</li>
<li><strong>Net Profit Margin (Inferred):</strong> 19.1% (₹45,908 crore / ₹240,893 crore)</li>
<li><strong>ROE (Return on Equity) (Inferred):</strong>  This requires the average shareholder&rsquo;s equity for the year.  The report doesn&rsquo;t provide this directly.  Assuming an average of approximately ₹85,000 crore (midpoint between beginning and ending balance of ₹74,722 crore and ₹95,475 crore), we get:  54.0% (₹45,908 crore / ₹85,000 crore). Note: this is a rough estimate.</li>
<li><strong>ROA (Return on Assets) (Inferred):</strong>  Requires average total assets for the year, which is also not provided directly.  Similarly using a midpoint estimate of ₹138,000 crore, we get 33.3% (₹46,099 crore/₹138,000 crore). This is also a rough estimate.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Standalone Financial Statements:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Revenue:</strong> ₹202,359 crore</li>
<li><strong>Gross Profit (Inferred):</strong> ₹55,307 crore (This is calculated by subtracting the inferred cost of services from Revenue)</li>
<li><strong>Gross Margin (Inferred):</strong> 27.3% (₹55,307 crore / ₹202,359 crore)</li>
<li><strong>Operating Margin:</strong> This is not directly provided in the standalone statements and needs calculation. Assuming operating income as ₹55,307 crore (as inferred earlier), the operating margin is approximately 27.3% (₹55,307 crore / ₹202,359 crore).</li>
<li><strong>Net Profit Margin (Inferred):</strong> 21.5% (₹43,559 crore / ₹202,359 crore)</li>
<li><strong>ROE (Return on Equity) (Inferred):</strong> Using a rough average shareholder&rsquo;s equity of ₹78,000 crore (midpoint between beginning and ending balance from the statement of changes in equity), we get:  55.8% (₹43,559 crore / ₹78,000 crore). Note: this is a rough estimate.</li>
<li><strong>ROA (Return on Assets) (Inferred):</strong> Using a midpoint estimate of ₹107,000 crore for average total assets, we get: 40.8% (₹43,559 crore/₹107,000 crore).  This is a rough estimate.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Notes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>All values are in Indian Rupees (₹) and are rounded.</li>
<li>The calculations for gross profit, gross margin, net profit margin, ROE, and ROA are <em>approximations</em> due to the absence of certain line items and the need to infer values from the provided text.</li>
<li>The standalone figures represent only TCS Limited, whereas consolidated figures include all subsidiaries.  The differences between standalone and consolidated ratios highlight the impact of subsidiaries.</li>
<li>For precise values, it is imperative to refer to the official, certified financial statements within the complete annual report.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="heading" id="liquidity-ratios">
  Liquidity Ratios
  <a class="anchor" href="#liquidity-ratios">#</a>
</h3>
<p>The annual report provides both consolidated and standalone financial statements.  We can approximate the liquidity ratios, but precise calculation requires the exact figures from the certified statements.  Also, the calculation of the quick ratio requires a precise identification of current assets which are readily convertible into cash and current liabilities.  The annual report does not provide a granular breakdown of such data.  Therefore, the values here are <em>approximations</em> based on the summarized data provided in the transcription:</p>
<p><strong>Consolidated Financial Statements:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Current Ratio (Inferred):</strong>  Current Ratio = Current Assets / Current Liabilities.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Current Assets:</strong> ₹46,104 crore</li>
<li><strong>Current Liabilities:</strong> ₹46,104 crore</li>
<li><strong>Current Ratio (Inferred):</strong> 1.0 (₹46,104 crore / ₹46,104 crore).  This is unusual and should be verified directly with the financial statements.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Quick Ratio (Inferred):</strong>  This cannot be accurately calculated without a more detailed breakdown of current assets (excluding inventories and prepaid expenses) from the original report.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cash Ratio (Inferred):</strong> Cash Ratio = (Cash and Cash Equivalents) / Current Liabilities.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cash and Cash Equivalents:</strong> ₹9,016 crore</li>
<li><strong>Current Liabilities:</strong> ₹46,104 crore</li>
<li><strong>Cash Ratio (Inferred):</strong> 0.2 (₹9,016 crore / ₹46,104 crore)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Standalone Financial Statements:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Current Ratio (Inferred):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Current Assets:</strong> ₹94,918 crore</li>
<li><strong>Current Liabilities:</strong> ₹43,061 crore</li>
<li><strong>Current Ratio (Inferred):</strong> 2.2 (₹94,918 crore / ₹43,061 crore)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Quick Ratio (Inferred):</strong>  Cannot be accurately calculated without further detail on current assets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cash Ratio (Inferred):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cash and Cash Equivalents:</strong> ₹3,644 crore</li>
<li><strong>Current Liabilities:</strong> ₹43,061 crore</li>
<li><strong>Cash Ratio (Inferred):</strong> 0.08 (₹3,644 crore / ₹43,061 crore)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Notes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>All values are in Indian Rupees (₹) and rounded to the nearest crore.</li>
<li>The calculations for the current and cash ratios are <em>approximations</em>.  The quick ratio cannot be computed accurately due to insufficient data in the transcription.</li>
<li>Standalone figures pertain only to TCS Limited, while consolidated values include all subsidiaries.</li>
</ul>
<p>To obtain precise liquidity ratio values, consult the original, certified financial statements in the annual report.  The discrepancies between the standalone and consolidated figures are due to the inclusion of subsidiary companies&rsquo; financials in the consolidated statements.  The unusual current ratio of 1.0 in the consolidated statements should be investigated, as a healthy current ratio is typically higher than 1.</p>
<h3 class="heading" id="efficiency-ratios">
  Efficiency Ratios
  <a class="anchor" href="#efficiency-ratios">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Calculating precise efficiency ratios requires the exact figures from the certified financial statements and a precise understanding of the accounting methods used. The report provides some data, but a complete calculation requires more details than are available in the transcription.  Here&rsquo;s what we can approximate, keeping in mind these are <em>inferred calculations</em> based on the available data and certain assumptions:</p>
<p><strong>Consolidated Financial Statements:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Revenue:</strong> ₹240,893 crore</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Average Total Assets:</strong> This is not explicitly given. We&rsquo;ll estimate this by averaging the beginning and ending balances of total assets from the consolidated balance sheet.  Assume an average of approximately ₹138,000 crore.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Asset Turnover (Inferred):</strong> Asset Turnover = Revenue / Average Total Assets.   Therefore: 1.74 (₹240,893 crore / ₹138,000 crore)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Average Inventory:</strong>  Average inventory requires the beginning and ending inventory figures. Assume an average of approximately ₹28 crore.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Inventory Turnover (Inferred):</strong> Inventory Turnover = Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory.  We need the cost of goods sold (COGS), which is not explicitly stated and requires inferring from various cost components in the financial statements.  This calculation is not reliable based on this text alone.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Average Accounts Receivable:</strong>  Needs the beginning and ending receivables.  Using an approximation of ₹50,000 crore average accounts receivable (billed and unbilled combined), we get:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Receivables Turnover (Inferred):</strong> Receivables Turnover = Revenue / Average Accounts Receivable.  Therefore: 4.82 (₹240,893 crore / ₹50,000 crore)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Standalone Financial Statements:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Revenue:</strong> ₹202,359 crore</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Average Total Assets:</strong>  Again, this needs to be calculated. Let&rsquo;s assume an average of ₹107,000 crore using a midpoint estimate of beginning and ending assets from the standalone balance sheet.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Asset Turnover (Inferred):</strong> 1.9 (₹202,359 crore / ₹107,000 crore)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Average Inventory:</strong> Assume an average of ₹27 crore.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Inventory Turnover (Inferred):</strong> This again requires the cost of goods sold, which cannot be reliably inferred from the provided data.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Average Accounts Receivable:</strong> Using an approximate average of ₹43,000 crore, we obtain:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Receivables Turnover (Inferred):</strong>  4.7 (₹202,359 crore / ₹43,000 crore)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Notes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>All values are in Indian Rupees (₹) and rounded.</li>
<li>The calculations for asset turnover, inventory turnover, and receivables turnover are <em>rough approximations</em> due to missing or summarized data in the text transcription.</li>
<li>The standalone data represents only TCS Limited, whereas the consolidated data includes all subsidiaries.</li>
<li>For accurate results, direct consultation of the original standalone and consolidated financial statements within the annual report is strongly advised.  The chosen average asset values are estimations and could significantly affect the asset turnover calculation.  Similarly, accurate inventory turnover requires a precise cost of goods sold figure, which is not readily available from the transcription.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="heading" id="leverage-ratios">
  Leverage Ratios
  <a class="anchor" href="#leverage-ratios">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Similar to other ratios, calculating precise use ratios requires the exact figures from the certified financial statements, and a detailed understanding of how the company accounts for its liabilities. The transcription only provides summarized data.  Therefore, the following are <em>approximations</em> based on the available information and certain assumptions:</p>
<p><strong>Consolidated Financial Statements:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Debt to Equity Ratio (Inferred):</strong> Debt to Equity Ratio = Total Debt / Shareholders&rsquo; Equity. The report does not clearly separate &ldquo;Total Debt&rdquo; as a single line item, therefore, this needs to be estimated by adding up various financial liabilities (short term and long term):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Total Debt (Inferred):</strong> ₹28,821 crore (this approximates total financial liabilities from the consolidated balance sheet).</li>
<li><strong>Shareholders&rsquo; Equity:</strong> ₹90,127 crore (as of March 31, 2024)</li>
<li><strong>Debt to Equity Ratio (Inferred):</strong> 0.32 (₹28,821 crore / ₹90,127 crore)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Debt to Assets Ratio (Inferred):</strong> Debt to Assets Ratio = Total Debt / Total Assets.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Total Debt (Inferred):</strong> ₹28,821 crore</li>
<li><strong>Total Assets:</strong> ₹146,449 crore</li>
<li><strong>Debt to Assets Ratio (Inferred):</strong> 0.20 (₹28,821 crore / ₹146,449 crore)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Interest Coverage Ratio (Inferred):</strong> Interest Coverage Ratio = Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT) / Interest Expense.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>EBIT:</strong> ₹59,311 crore</li>
<li><strong>Interest Expense:</strong> ₹778 crore</li>
<li><strong>Interest Coverage Ratio (Inferred):</strong> 76.2 (₹59,311 crore / ₹778 crore)</li>

<li><strong>Shareholders&rsquo; Equity:</strong> ₹72,120 crore (as of March 31, 2024)</li>
<li><strong>Debt to Equity Ratio (Inferred):</strong> 0.41 (₹29,262 crore / ₹72,120 crore)</li>

<li><strong>Interest Coverage Ratio (Inferred):</strong> 87.0 (₹58,560 crore / ₹673 crore)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Notes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>All values are in Indian Rupees (₹) and rounded to the nearest crore.</li>
<li>The calculations for these ratios are <em>approximations</em>.  The precise values depend on how exactly the company classifies certain items on its balance sheet, and requires specific values not fully available from the text transcription. For example, the calculation of total debt is based on a summation of various financial liabilities (short and long term) present in the Balance sheet.</li>
<li>The standalone figures are only for TCS Limited, while the consolidated figures include all subsidiaries.  Therefore, the differences in use ratios between standalone and consolidated reflect the financial structure of subsidiaries.</li>
<li>To obtain completely accurate use ratios, direct consultation of the original standalone and consolidated financial statements and related notes in the complete annual report is necessary.

<p>The annual report provides some of this information, but others require calculations and assumptions.  Also, market-based ratios like the PE and PB ratios will vary depending on the share price at the time of the calculation. The values given below are based on data available in the report and therefore are approximations:</p>
<p><strong>Consolidated Financial Statements:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Market Capitalization:</strong> Not explicitly given.  This would require knowing the closing share price on the relevant date (March 31, 2024) and the number of outstanding shares.  Market cap is also often calculated using the average closing price over a given period (e.g. the last trading day).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>P/E Ratio (Price-to-Earnings Ratio):</strong> Not explicitly given.  The calculation requires the market capitalization and earnings per share (EPS).  The report provides the EPS (₹125.88).  Using the 10-year trend of the P/E ratio, and assuming it stayed consistent for FY24 and using a closing market cap of ₹14,000,000 crore (a rough approximation based on the provided market cap data in the report for the period), we arrive at an estimated P/E ratio of 30.8 for the year ended March 31, 2024.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>P/B Ratio (Price-to-Book Ratio):</strong> Not explicitly given. Calculation requires market capitalization and book value of equity.  The report gives the book value of equity.  Using the same approximate market cap of ₹14,000,000 crore and approximating the book value of equity to ₹85,000 crore (midpoint between opening and closing), we obtain a P/B ratio of approximately 165.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dividend Yield:</strong> Not explicitly given.  The calculation requires annual dividend per share and the share price at the end of the year.  Using the total dividend of ₹73 and an approximated closing price of ₹3900, we arrive at a dividend yield of approximately 1.87%.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dividend Payout Ratio (Inferred):</strong> Dividend Payout Ratio = Dividends Paid / Net Income.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dividends Paid:</strong> ₹26,486 crore (this accounts for both interim and final dividends)</li>
<li><strong>Net Income:</strong> ₹45,908 crore</li>
<li><strong>Dividend Payout Ratio (Inferred):</strong> 57.7% (₹26,486 crore / ₹45,908 crore)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Standalone Financial Statements:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Market Capitalization:</strong> As mentioned before, this is not directly provided and is a key value needed for calculating other market metrics.  Using the same approximate market cap of ₹14,000,000 crore, this can be considered.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>P/E Ratio (Price-to-Earnings Ratio):</strong> This needs to be calculated from market cap and EPS. Using the given EPS of ₹119.44, we can estimate the standalone P/E ratio as approximately 29.3, based on the same approximated market cap used above.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>P/B Ratio (Price-to-Book Ratio):</strong>  This requires market capitalization and book value. Using the same estimated market cap and an approximated book value of ₹78,000 crore (midpoint of opening and closing from Statement of Changes in Equity), we obtain a P/B ratio of approximately 180.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dividend Yield:</strong> Using the total dividend of ₹73 and an approximate closing price of ₹3900, we arrive at a dividend yield of approximately 1.87%.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dividend Payout Ratio (Inferred):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dividends Paid:</strong> ₹26,486 crore</li>
<li><strong>Net Income:</strong> ₹43,559 crore</li>
<li><strong>Dividend Payout Ratio (Inferred):</strong> 60.8% (₹26,486 crore / ₹43,559 crore)</li>

  Audit Information

</h3>
<p>The annual report includes both standalone and consolidated financial statements, each with its own auditor&rsquo;s report.  Both reports express an unmodified (clean) opinion.</p>
<p><strong>Auditor&rsquo;s Opinion (Both Consolidated and Standalone):</strong></p>
<p>The independent auditors, B S R &amp; Co. LLP, expressed an unqualified (clean) opinion on both the consolidated and standalone financial statements.  This means, in their professional judgment, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position, financial performance, and cash flows of TCS Limited (standalone) and its consolidated group (consolidated) in accordance with Indian Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and applicable Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS).</p>
<p><strong>Key Accounting Policies (Summary):</strong></p>
<p>The notes to the financial statements detail the accounting policies used.  Key aspects include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Basis of Consolidation:</strong>  The consolidated financial statements include all subsidiaries controlled by TCS Limited.  The acquisition method is used for business combinations.</li>
<li><strong>Basis of Presentation:</strong> The financial statements are presented using the historical cost convention, except for certain financial instruments (measured at fair value or amortized cost) and defined benefit plans (using the projected unit credit method).</li>
<li><strong>Revenue Recognition:</strong>  Revenue recognition principles generally adhere to Ind AS 115.  Different methods are used depending on the contract type (fixed price, time and materials, etc.).  Percentage-of-completion method is used for certain fixed-price contracts.  Significant judgment is involved in determining performance obligations, transaction price allocation, and degree of completion.</li>
<li><strong>Property, Plant, and Equipment:</strong>  Recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives.</li>
<li><strong>Intangible Assets:</strong>  Recorded at cost less accumulated amortization and impairment losses.  Amortization is done over their useful lives.</li>
<li><strong>Financial Instruments:</strong>  Initial measurement at fair value (except for trade receivables); subsequent measurement at amortized cost, fair value through other detailed income (FVOCI), or fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL), depending on the instrument and the Company&rsquo;s business model.  Significant judgments are involved in fair value estimations.</li>
<li><strong>Impairment of Assets:</strong>  Assets are tested for impairment whenever there&rsquo;s an indication of potential recoverability issues.</li>
<li><strong>Employee Benefits:</strong>  Defined benefit plans are accounted for using the projected unit credit method; defined contribution plans are expensed when services are rendered.</li>
<li><strong>Income Taxes:</strong>  Current and deferred taxes are recognized in accordance with Ind AS 12.</li>
<li><strong>Leases:</strong>  The Company applies Ind AS 116, Leases.  Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are recognized.  Certain short-term and low-value leases are exempt from the Ind AS 116 requirements.</li>
<li><strong>Foreign Currency Translation:</strong>  Financial statements of foreign operations are translated using the prevailing exchange rates at the balance sheet date (assets and liabilities) and weighted average exchange rates (profit or loss).  Translation differences are recognized in other detailed income.</li>
<li><strong>Government Grants:</strong>  Government grants are recognized in the period in which the conditions attaching to those grants have been met.</li>
</ul>
