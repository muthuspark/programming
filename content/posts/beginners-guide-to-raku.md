## Introduction to Raku

### What is Raku?

Raku (formerly known as Perl 6) is a powerful, dynamic, and highly expressive programming language designed for both beginners and experienced programmers. It's built on the principles of elegance, readability, and concurrency, offering a modern approach to software development.  Raku incorporates many features found in other modern languages while maintaining a unique and powerful paradigm of its own.  It prioritizes developer happiness and productivity through features like sophisticated metaprogramming capabilities, built-in concurrency support, and a rich standard library.  The language is designed to be easy to learn, yet capable of handling complex tasks with grace.


### Why learn Raku?

Learning Raku offers several compelling advantages:

* **Readability and Maintainability:** Raku's syntax is designed for clarity and ease of understanding. This reduces development time and makes it easier to maintain and collaborate on projects.

* **Modern Features:** Raku boasts modern features such as built-in concurrency, powerful regular expressions, advanced type systems (for increased safety and code clarity), and a rich standard library that simplifies many common tasks.

* **Expressiveness and Conciseness:**  You can often accomplish complex tasks with less code in Raku compared to other languages. This leads to increased productivity and reduced development time.

* **Strong Community:**  While smaller than some other languages, the Raku community is known for being welcoming and helpful, offering support and resources to learners.

* **Growing Ecosystem:**  The Raku ecosystem is continuously growing, with new modules and libraries constantly being developed.


### Setting up your Raku environment

The easiest way to get started with Raku is using the official installer for your operating system.  You can find the latest installers and instructions at the official Raku website ([https://raku.org/](https://raku.org/)).  The installation process usually involves downloading an installer and following the on-screen instructions.  This will typically add Raku to your system's PATH, allowing you to run Raku commands from your terminal or command prompt.

Alternatively, some package managers (like `apt` on Debian/Ubuntu, `brew` on macOS, or `choco` on Windows) may offer Raku packages.  Consult your package manager's documentation for specific instructions.


### Running your first Raku program

The simplest Raku program is a "Hello, world!" program.  Create a file named `hello.raku` (or any name ending in `.raku`) containing the following line:

```raku
say "Hello, world!";
```

To run this program, open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and type:

```bash
raku hello.raku
```

Press Enter.  You should see "Hello, world!" printed on the console.  This simple example demonstrates the basic syntax of Raku—using the `say` function to output text to the console.  Congratulations, you've run your first Raku program!


## Basic Syntax and Data Types

### Variables and Constants

Raku uses a sigil system to distinguish variable types.  Variables are declared implicitly by assigning a value to them.  The sigil indicates the variable's type and scope.

* `$` (dollar sign):  Scalar variable.  Holds a single value (e.g., number, string).
* `@` (at sign): Array variable. Holds an ordered list of values.
* `%` (percent sign): Hash variable. Holds a collection of key-value pairs.

```raku
my $name = "Alice";  # Scalar variable
my @numbers = 1, 2, 3; # Array variable
my %details = name => "Bob", age => 30; # Hash variable

say $name;  # Outputs: Alice
say @numbers; # Outputs: (1 2 3)
say %details; # Outputs: name => "Bob", age => 30
```

Constants are declared using the `constant` keyword.  Their values cannot be changed after declaration.

```raku
constant $PI = 3.14159;
# $PI = 3.14;  # This would result in a compile-time error
```

The `my` keyword declares lexical variables, which are scoped to the block of code in which they are defined.  Variables declared without `my` (though generally discouraged) are package variables, having broader scope.


### Data Types (Scalars, Lists, Hashes)

Raku's fundamental data types include:

* **Scalars:**  Represent single values.  They can be of various types, including:
    * **Integers:** Whole numbers (e.g., 10, -5, 0).
    * **Numbers:** Floating-point numbers (e.g., 3.14, -2.5).
    * **Strings:** Sequences of characters (e.g., "Hello", 'Raku').
    * **Booleans:** `True` or `False`.

* **Lists:** Ordered collections of values.  They are created using commas `,` or the `[...]` syntax.

    ```raku
    my @list = 1, 2, 3, "four"; # List of mixed types
    my @anotherList = [5, 6, 7]; # Another way to define a list
    ```

* **Hashes:** Unordered collections of key-value pairs. Keys are typically strings, but can be other data types as well.  They are created using `=>` or the `{ }` syntax.

    ```raku
    my %hash = name => "Charlie", age => 25; # Using =>
    my %anotherHash = { city => "New York", country => "USA" }; # Using curly braces
    ```


### Operators

Raku supports a wide range of operators, including:

* **Arithmetic Operators:**  `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%` (modulo), `**` (exponentiation).
* **Comparison Operators:** `==` (equal to), `!=` (not equal to), `>` (greater than), `<` (less than), `>=` (greater than or equal to), `<=` (less than or equal to).
* **Logical Operators:** `&&` (and), `||` (or), `!` (not).
* **String Operators:** `.join` (concatenates strings), `~~` (smartmatch operator).
* **Assignment Operators:** `=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, etc.


### Control Flow (if/else, loops)

* **`if`/`elsif`/`else` statements:**  Used for conditional execution.

```raku
my $x = 10;
if $x > 5 {
    say "x is greater than 5";
} elsif $x == 5 {
    say "x is equal to 5";
} else {
    say "x is less than 5";
}
```

* **`for` loop:** Iterates over a list or range.

```raku
for 1..5 -> $i { # Iterates from 1 to 5
    say $i;
}

for @numbers -> $num { # Iterates over the array @numbers
    say $num;
}
```

* **`while` loop:** Repeats a block of code as long as a condition is true.

```raku
my $count = 0;
while $count < 3 {
    say $count;
    $count++;
}
```

* **`loop` loop:**  A general-purpose loop that continues indefinitely until explicitly stopped using `last`, `break`, or a condition within.

```raku
loop {
    say "Looping...";
    last if $count >= 5; # Exit the loop if count is 5 or more.
    $count++;
}
```

These are the fundamental building blocks for creating more complex Raku programs.  Remember to consult the official Raku documentation for more in-depth explanations and advanced features.


## Working with Data

### Input and Output

Raku provides several ways to handle input and output:

**Output:** The simplest way to output data is using the `say` function, which automatically adds a newline character at the end:

```raku
say "Hello, world!";
say 1 + 2;  # Outputs 3
```

For more fine-grained control, use `print`:

```raku
print "This is a line. ";
print "This is on the same line.\n"; # \n adds a newline explicitly.
```

**Input:**  The `prompt` function is used to get input from the user:

```raku
my $name = prompt "What is your name? ";
say "Hello, $name!";
```

For reading from a file, use the `slurp` function (for reading entire file content into a string) or the `IO::Handle` class for more complex file operations:

```raku
my $file-content = slurp("my-file.txt");
say $file-content;

my $fh = open("my-file.txt", :r); #open file for reading
while $fh.more {
    my $line = $fh.get;
    say $line;
}
$fh.close;
```

Remember to handle potential errors when working with files (e.g., file not found).


### Working with Strings

Raku provides extensive support for string manipulation.  Strings are enclosed in double quotes (`"`) or single quotes (`'`).  Double-quoted strings allow for interpolation (embedding variables within the string):

```raku
my $name = "Alice";
say "Hello, $name!";  # Interpolation; outputs "Hello, Alice!"
say 'Hello, $name!';  # No interpolation; outputs "Hello, $name!"
```

String methods include:

* `.uc` (uppercase), `.lc` (lowercase), `.title` (title case)
* `.contains` (checks if a substring exists)
* `.substr` (extracts a substring)
* `.index` (finds the index of a substring)
* `.chop` (removes the last character)


### Working with Numbers

Raku handles integers and floating-point numbers seamlessly.  Basic arithmetic operations are straightforward:

```raku
my $a = 10;
my $b = 3;
say $a + $b;  # Addition
say $a - $b;  # Subtraction
say $a * $b;  # Multiplication
say $a / $b;  # Division (floating-point result)
say $a % $b;  # Modulo (remainder)
```

Raku also provides numerous math functions via the `Math` module:

```raku
use Math;
say sqrt(25); # Square root
say sin(π/2); # Sine function (requires importing π)
```


### Data Structures (Arrays, Hashes)

**Arrays:**  Ordered collections of elements.  Access elements using their index (starting from 0):

```raku
my @array = <apple banana cherry>;
say @array[0]; # Outputs: apple
say @array.elems; #Number of elements in the array
@array.push("date"); # Add an element to the end
say @array;
```

**Hashes:** Collections of key-value pairs. Access values using their keys:

```raku
my %hash = fruit => "apple", color => "red";
say %hash<fruit>;  # Outputs: apple
say %hash.keys; #Outputs keys as a list
say %hash.values; #Outputs values as a list
%hash<size> = "medium"; # Add a new key-value pair

```

Arrays and hashes can contain elements of different data types.  Raku provides many built-in methods for manipulating arrays and hashes (e.g., sorting, searching, filtering).  Refer to the Raku documentation for a complete list.


## Functions and Subroutines

### Defining Functions

In Raku, functions (and subroutines; the terms are often used interchangeably) are defined using the `sub` keyword followed by the function name, parameters in parentheses, and the code block enclosed in curly braces `{}`:

```raku
sub greet(Str $name) {
    say "Hello, $name!";
}

greet("Alice");  # Calls the greet function
```

This defines a function named `greet` that takes a single string parameter `$name` and prints a greeting.  The `Str` indicates that the parameter `$name` should be a string.


### Function Parameters

Functions can accept multiple parameters, and you can specify parameter types for better type safety and code clarity.  Parameters can have default values:


```raku
sub add(Int $a, Int $b = 0) { # $b has a default value of 0
    return $a + $b;
}

say add(5, 3);   # Outputs 8
say add(10);    # Outputs 10 (uses default value for $b)

sub describe(Str $name, Int $age, Str $city is optional) {
    say "$name is $age years old";
    if $city {
        say "and lives in $city";
    }
}

describe("Bob", 30, "New York");
describe("Alice", 25); # city is optional.
```

The `is optional` trait makes the `$city` parameter optional.  If not provided, it is treated as `Nil`.



### Return Values

Functions return values using the `return` keyword or implicitly by the last statement evaluated.

```raku
sub square(Numeric $x) {
    return $x * $x; # Explicit return
}

sub cube(Numeric $x) {
    $x * $x * $x # Implicit return
}

say square(5);   # Outputs 25
say cube(2);    #Outputs 8
```


### Anonymous Functions

Anonymous functions (also called closures or lambdas) are functions without a name. They are defined using the `->` operator:

```raku
my $add = -> Int $a, Int $b { $a + $b };  # Anonymous function assigned to $add
say $add(7, 2);  # Outputs 9

my @numbers = 1..5;
my @squares = @numbers.map( -> Int $n { $n * $n }); # Using an anonymous function with map
say @squares; # Outputs (1 4 9 16 25)

```

Anonymous functions are particularly useful when you need a short, simple function that is only used once, like within the `map` method above.  They improve code readability and reduce the need for defining many small named functions.


## Object-Oriented Programming in Raku

### Classes and Objects

Raku supports object-oriented programming (OOP) through classes and objects.  A class is a blueprint for creating objects.  Objects are instances of a class.  Classes are defined using the `class` keyword:


```raku
class Dog {
    has Str $.name;
    has Int $.age;

    method greet() {
        say "Woof! My name is {$.name}.";
    }
}

my $dog1 = Dog.new(name => "Buddy", age => 3);
$dog1.greet();  # Outputs: Woof! My name is Buddy.
say $dog1.name; #Outputs: Buddy
```

This defines a `Dog` class with attributes (instance variables) `name` and `age`.  The `.new` method is used to create new objects (instances) of the class, and it initializes the object's attributes using named parameters.  The `has` keyword declares instance variables, automatically creating accessors (getters and setters).


### Methods

Methods are functions defined within a class. They operate on the object's data:

```raku
class Cat {
    has Str $.name;
    has Int $.age;

    method meow() {
        say "Meow!";
    }

    method describe() {
        say "My name is {$.name}, and I am {$.age} years old.";
    }
}

my $cat1 = Cat.new(name => "Whiskers", age => 5);
$cat1.meow();       # Outputs: Meow!
$cat1.describe();   # Outputs: My name is Whiskers, and I am 5 years old.
```

Methods access the object's attributes using the `$` sigil followed by the attribute name.


### Inheritance

Inheritance allows you to create new classes based on existing classes.  The new class inherits the attributes and methods of the parent class:

```raku
class Animal {
    has Str $.name;
    has Int $.age;

    method speak() {
        say "Generic animal sound";
    }
}

class Dog is Animal {  # Dog inherits from Animal
    method speak() {
        say "Woof!";
    }
}

my $animal = Animal.new(name => "Generic", age => 1);
my $dog = Dog.new(name => "Fido", age => 2);

$animal.speak(); # Outputs: Generic animal sound
$dog.speak();    # Outputs: Woof!
```

The `is` keyword indicates inheritance.  The `Dog` class inherits `name` and `age` and overrides the `speak` method.


### Polymorphism

Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to respond to the same method call in their own specific way.  This is demonstrated in the inheritance example above: both `Animal` and `Dog` have a `speak` method, but they produce different outputs.  This is a key benefit of OOP in Raku, enabling flexibility and code reusability.  Another example could be using a common interface:


```raku
role SoundMaker {
    method make-sound() {
        say "A generic sound";
    }
}

class Dog does SoundMaker {
    method make-sound() {
        say "Woof!";
    }
}

class Cat does SoundMaker {
    method make-sound() {
        say "Meow!";
    }
}

my $dog = Dog.new;
my $cat = Cat.new;
$dog.make-sound(); #Woof!
$cat.make-sound(); #Meow!
```

Here, `Dog` and `Cat` both implement the `make-sound` method from the `SoundMaker` role, resulting in polymorphic behaviour.  Roles provide a way to add behaviour to classes without using inheritance directly, improving code flexibility and maintainability.


## Advanced Topics

### Exception Handling

Raku uses `try`, `catch`, and `finally` blocks for exception handling.  Exceptions are objects that represent errors or exceptional situations during program execution.

```raku
try {
    my $result = 10 / 0; # This will cause a division by zero error
    say $result;
} catch {
    when X::DivisionByZero {
        say "Division by zero error!";
    }
    when Exception {  # Catch any other exception
        say "An error occurred: {$_.message}";
    }
} finally {
    say "This always executes.";
}
```

The `try` block contains the code that might throw an exception.  The `catch` block handles specific exceptions using `when`.  The `finally` block executes regardless of whether an exception occurred.


### Modules and Packages

Modules and packages organize Raku code into reusable units. Modules contain code, while packages group related modules.  Modules are imported using the `use` keyword:

```raku
use Math; #Import the Math module

say sqrt(25); # Use a function from the Math module
```

Creating your own module involves placing code in a file named `<modulename>.raku` (e.g., `MyModule.raku`) and using the `module` keyword:

```raku
# MyModule.raku
module MyModule;

sub greet(Str $name) {
    say "Hello from MyModule, $name!";
}
```

Then, you would import it into another file:


```raku
use MyModule;

greet("World"); #Calls the greet subroutine from MyModule
```

Packages provide a way to group related modules to avoid naming conflicts.


### Concurrency and Parallelism

Raku offers built-in support for concurrency and parallelism. Concurrency involves managing multiple tasks seemingly at the same time, while parallelism involves running multiple tasks truly simultaneously on multiple cores.

**Concurrency:**  Raku's `start` keyword allows you to create and manage asynchronous tasks:

```raku
my $promise = start {
    sleep 2;
    return "Task completed!";
};

say "Doing other things...";
say $promise.await;  # Wait for the task to finish and get its result
```

**Parallelism:** Raku's `react` construct enables running multiple tasks in parallel:

```raku
react {
    whenever supply 1..5 -> $i {
      say "Processing number: $i";
    }
}
```

Note that  `react` is a more advanced feature and will require understanding of asynchronous programming concepts.


### Metaprogramming

Metaprogramming involves writing code that manipulates or generates other code at compile time or runtime.  Raku's powerful metaprogramming capabilities allow you to create DSLs (domain-specific languages), code generation tools, and other advanced features:

```raku
my class MyClass {
    method foo() {
        say "Hello from foo";
    }
}

# Generate a method dynamically
MyClass.add_method("bar", -> { say "Hello from bar"; });

my $obj = MyClass.new;
$obj.foo();   # Outputs: Hello from foo
$obj.bar();   # Outputs: Hello from bar
```

Here, `add_method` dynamically adds a new method to the class at runtime. Raku provides many advanced features for metaprogramming,  but this requires a deeper understanding of the language's internals.
