## Setting up your Java Environment

This section guides you through setting up your Java Development Kit (JDK) and choosing an Integrated Development Environment (IDE).  These steps are crucial before you can start writing and running Java code.

### Downloading the JDK

1. **Navigate to the Oracle website:** Go to the official Oracle website's Java downloads page.  (The exact URL may change, so search for "Java JDK download Oracle").
2. **Accept the License Agreement:** You'll need to accept the Oracle Technology Network License Agreement to download the JDK.
3. **Choose the correct JDK version:**  Select the JDK version appropriate for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux) and architecture (64-bit is generally recommended).  For beginners, the latest LTS (Long Term Support) release is usually a good choice.
4. **Download the installer:** Download the installer file (.exe for Windows, .dmg for macOS, or a .tar.gz or .zip file for Linux).


### Installing the JDK

The installation process varies slightly depending on your operating system:

* **Windows:** Double-click the downloaded .exe file and follow the on-screen instructions.  You might be asked to choose an installation directory;  accept the defaults unless you have a specific reason to change them.
* **macOS:** Double-click the downloaded .dmg file. Drag the JDK folder into the Applications folder.
* **Linux:** Extract the downloaded archive (e.g., using `tar -xzvf jdk-XXX.tar.gz`) to your desired location.

Remember the installation directory; you'll need it later when setting the PATH.


### Setting up your PATH environment variable

The PATH environment variable tells your operating system where to find the Java compiler (`javac`) and Java Virtual Machine (`java`).  This is essential for running Java programs from the command line.

The exact steps for setting the PATH variable depend on your operating system:

* **Windows:**
    1. Search for "environment variables" in the Windows search bar.
    2. Click on "Edit the system environment variables".
    3. Click on "Environment Variables...".
    4. Under "System variables", find the variable named "Path" and select it.
    5. Click "Edit...".
    6. Click "New" and add the path to the `bin` directory within your JDK installation directory (e.g., `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-17\bin`).  You may need to add multiple paths if you have other Java-related tools installed.
    7. Click "OK" on all open dialog boxes.  You may need to restart your computer for the changes to take effect.

* **macOS/Linux:** The method varies depending on your shell (bash, zsh, etc.).  Generally, you'll need to edit your shell's configuration file (e.g., `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, `.profile`). Add a line similar to the following, replacing `/path/to/jdk/bin` with the actual path to your JDK's `bin` directory:

   ```bash
   export PATH="$PATH:/path/to/jdk/bin"
   ```

   Then, either source the configuration file (e.g., `source ~/.bashrc`) or restart your terminal.


### Verifying your Java installation

Open a command prompt (Windows) or terminal (macOS/Linux) and type the following commands:

```bash
java -version
javac -version
```

If Java is installed correctly, you should see output displaying the version numbers of both the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) and Java compiler.  If you get error messages, double-check your JDK installation and PATH settings.


### Choosing an IDE (IntelliJ, Eclipse, VS Code)

An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) makes Java development much easier.  Popular choices include:

* **IntelliJ IDEA:** A powerful and widely used IDE with a great community and excellent support for Java.  There's a free Community Edition and a paid Ultimate Edition.
* **Eclipse:** A long-standing, open-source IDE with extensive features and a large plugin ecosystem.
* **VS Code:** A lightweight and versatile code editor that, with the right extensions, becomes a fully functional Java IDE.  It's a good option if you prefer a less resource-intensive environment.

Download and install your chosen IDE.  Each IDE has its own tutorials and documentation to help you get started.


## Your First Java Program

This section walks you through creating, compiling, and running your very first Java program – the classic "Hello, World!" program. This will introduce you to the fundamental structure and syntax of Java.

### The 'Hello, World!' program

The simplest Java program prints the text "Hello, World!" to the console.  Here's the code:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

Save this code in a file named `Main.java`.  The filename *must* match the class name (`Main` in this case).


### Understanding the structure of a Java program

Let's break down the "Hello, World!" program:

* **`public class Main { ... }`**: This declares a class named `Main`.  In Java, everything runs inside a class.  The `public` keyword means this class is accessible from anywhere.
* **`public static void main(String[] args) { ... }`**: This is the `main` method, the entry point of your program.  The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) starts executing your program from here.
    * `public`:  Means the method is accessible from anywhere.
    * `static`: Allows the method to be called without creating an object of the class.
    * `void`: Indicates that the method doesn't return any value.
    * `main`: The specific name that the JVM looks for to start execution.
    * `String[] args`: An array of strings that can be passed as command-line arguments to your program.
* **`System.out.println("Hello, World!");`**: This line prints the text "Hello, World!" to the console.
    * `System`: A predefined class in Java containing static members.
    * `out`: A static member of the `System` class, representing the standard output stream (usually your console).
    * `println()`: A method of the `out` object that prints a line of text to the console.


### Compiling and running your code

1. **Compilation:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved `Main.java`, and type the following command:

   ```bash
   javac Main.java
   ```

   This compiles your Java code into bytecode (`.class` files). If there are no errors, you'll see a `Main.class` file created in the same directory.

2. **Execution:** After successful compilation, run your program using:

   ```bash
   java Main
   ```

   This runs the bytecode using the JVM, and you should see "Hello, World!" printed on the console.


### Explanation of basic syntax

The "Hello, World!" program showcases several key aspects of Java syntax:

* **Case sensitivity:** Java is case-sensitive.  `Main` is different from `main`.
* **Semicolons:** Each statement in Java ends with a semicolon (;).
* **Curly braces `{}`:** Curly braces define blocks of code, such as the body of a class or a method.
* **Class declaration:**  The `class` keyword is used to define a class.
* **Method declaration:**  The structure of a method involves access modifiers (`public`, `static`), return type (`void`), method name (`main`), parameters (`String[] args`), and method body (`{}`).
* **System.out.println():** This is a standard way to print output to the console.  Note the use of the dot (`.`) operator to access members of classes and objects.


This basic program lays the groundwork for understanding more complex Java programs.  As you progress, you will learn about variables, data types, operators, control flow, and object-oriented programming concepts.


## Java Fundamentals

This section covers the essential building blocks of the Java programming language, including data types, variables, operators, control flow, and basic input/output.

### Data Types (int, float, double, boolean, char, String)

Java is a statically-typed language, meaning you must declare the data type of a variable before using it.  Here are some fundamental data types:

* **`int`:** Represents integers (whole numbers) with a range of approximately -2 billion to +2 billion.  Example: `int age = 30;`
* **`float`:** Represents single-precision floating-point numbers (numbers with decimal points).  Example: `float price = 19.99f;` (Note the `f` suffix is required.)
* **`double`:** Represents double-precision floating-point numbers, providing higher precision than `float`.  Example: `double balance = 1234.56;`
* **`boolean`:** Represents boolean values, which can be either `true` or `false`.  Example: `boolean isAdult = true;`
* **`char`:** Represents a single character.  Example: `char initial = 'J';`  Characters are enclosed in single quotes.
* **`String`:** Represents a sequence of characters.  This is not a primitive type but a class (more on classes later). Example: `String name = "John Doe";` Strings are enclosed in double quotes.


### Variables and Constants

* **Variables:**  Variables are used to store data that can change during the program's execution.  You declare a variable with its data type, a name, and an optional initial value.  Example: `int count = 0;`
* **Constants:** Constants are variables whose values cannot be changed after they are initialized.  You declare a constant using the `final` keyword. Example: `final double PI = 3.14159;`  It's a common convention to use uppercase names for constants.


### Operators (arithmetic, comparison, logical)

Java provides a wide range of operators:

* **Arithmetic operators:**  `+` (addition), `-` (subtraction), `*` (multiplication), `/` (division), `%` (modulo – remainder of a division).
* **Comparison operators:** `==` (equals), `!=` (not equals), `>` (greater than), `<` (less than), `>=` (greater than or equals), `<=` (less than or equals).  These operators return a `boolean` value.
* **Logical operators:** `&&` (logical AND), `||` (logical OR), `!` (logical NOT).  These operate on boolean values.


### Control Flow (if-else statements, switch statements, loops)

Control flow statements determine the order in which statements are executed:

* **`if-else` statements:**  Execute a block of code based on a condition.

   ```java
   if (age >= 18) {
       System.out.println("Adult");
   } else {
       System.out.println("Minor");
   }
   ```

* **`switch` statement:**  A more concise way to handle multiple conditions based on the value of an expression.

   ```java
   int day = 3;
   switch (day) {
       case 1: System.out.println("Monday"); break;
       case 2: System.out.println("Tuesday"); break;
       // ... more cases
       default: System.out.println("Other day");
   }
   ```

* **Loops:**  Repeat a block of code multiple times.

    * **`for` loop:**  Useful for iterating a specific number of times.

      ```java
      for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
          System.out.println(i);
      }
      ```

    * **`while` loop:**  Repeats a block of code as long as a condition is true.

      ```java
      int i = 0;
      while (i < 10) {
          System.out.println(i);
          i++;
      }
      ```

    * **`do-while` loop:** Similar to `while`, but the code block executes at least once.

      ```java
      int i = 0;
      do {
          System.out.println(i);
          i++;
      } while (i < 10);
      ```


### Input and Output (using Scanner)

The `Scanner` class allows you to get input from the user.

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.print("Enter your name: ");
        String name = scanner.nextLine();
        System.out.println("Hello, " + name + "!");
        scanner.close(); // Important: close the scanner when finished
    }
}
```

This code imports the `Scanner` class, creates a `Scanner` object to read from `System.in` (the standard input stream), prompts the user for their name, reads the input using `scanner.nextLine()`, and then prints a greeting.  Remember to close the `Scanner` using `scanner.close()` to release resources.  Output is handled using `System.out.println()` as shown in previous examples.


## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Basics

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a powerful programming paradigm that organizes code around "objects" rather than actions and data. Java is an object-oriented language, and understanding OOP concepts is crucial for writing effective Java programs.

### Classes and Objects

* **Classes:** A class is a blueprint for creating objects.  It defines the data (attributes or fields) and behavior (methods) that objects of that class will have.  Think of a class as a template or a cookie cutter.
* **Objects:** An object is an instance of a class. It's a concrete realization of the blueprint defined by the class.  Think of an object as the actual cookie created using the cookie cutter.

Example:  A `Dog` class might have attributes like `name`, `breed`, and `age`, and methods like `bark()`, `eat()`, and `wagTail()`.  Each individual dog you create would be an object of the `Dog` class.


### Constructors

A constructor is a special method within a class that is automatically called when an object of that class is created.  It's used to initialize the object's attributes.  A constructor has the same name as the class and doesn't have a return type (not even `void`).

```java
public class Dog {
    String name;
    String breed;
    int age;

    // Constructor
    public Dog(String name, String breed, int age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.breed = breed;
        this.age = age;
    }
}
```

This `Dog` class has a constructor that takes the dog's name, breed, and age as arguments and initializes the object's attributes.


### Methods

Methods define the behavior of objects.  They are functions that operate on the object's data.

```java
public class Dog {
    // ... (attributes as before) ...

    public void bark() {
        System.out.println("Woof!");
    }

    public void eat(String food) {
        System.out.println(name + " is eating " + food);
    }
}
```

This adds `bark()` and `eat()` methods to the `Dog` class.


### Encapsulation

Encapsulation involves bundling data (attributes) and methods that operate on that data within a class, and controlling access to that data.  This protects the data from accidental or unintended modification.  In Java, this is achieved using access modifiers:

* `public`: Accessible from anywhere.
* `private`: Accessible only within the class itself.
* `protected`: Accessible within the class, subclasses, and the same package.


### Abstraction

Abstraction hides complex implementation details and shows only essential information to the user.  Abstract classes and interfaces are key tools for abstraction in Java.

* **Abstract classes:** Classes that cannot be instantiated directly; they serve as blueprints for subclasses. They can contain both abstract methods (methods without a body) and concrete methods (methods with a body).
* **Interfaces:**  Define a contract that classes must implement.  They contain only abstract methods (since Java 8, they can also contain default and static methods).


### Inheritance

Inheritance allows you to create new classes (subclasses or derived classes) based on existing classes (superclasses or base classes).  The subclass inherits the attributes and methods of the superclass and can add its own unique attributes and methods.  This promotes code reusability.

```java
public class GoldenRetriever extends Dog { // GoldenRetriever inherits from Dog
    // ... additional attributes and methods specific to Golden Retrievers ...
}
```


### Polymorphism

Polymorphism means "many forms."  It allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common type.  This is often achieved through method overriding (where a subclass provides a specific implementation for a method inherited from the superclass) and interfaces.  This enables flexibility and extensibility in your code.

For example, both `Dog` and `Cat` could have a `makeSound()` method, but each would implement it differently (a dog barks, a cat meows).  You could then have a list of `Animal` objects (where `Dog` and `Cat` are subclasses of `Animal`) and call `makeSound()` on each without knowing the specific type of animal.


## Arrays and Collections

Java provides several ways to store and manage collections of data.  Arrays are fundamental, while collections offer more flexibility and functionality.

### Arrays

Arrays are fixed-size containers that hold elements of the same data type.  They are declared using square brackets `[]`.

```java
int[] numbers = new int[5]; // Array of 5 integers, initialized to 0
numbers[0] = 10;
numbers[1] = 20;
// ... and so on

String[] names = {"Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"}; // Array initialization with values

System.out.println(numbers[0]); // Accessing an element
System.out.println(names.length); // Getting the array's length
```

Arrays have a fixed size determined at creation; you cannot easily add or remove elements after creation.  To resize, you need to create a new array and copy the elements.


### ArrayLists

`ArrayLists` are dynamic arrays that can grow or shrink as needed.  They are part of the Java Collections Framework and offer more flexibility than standard arrays.  `ArrayLists` can hold objects of any type.

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ArrayList<Integer> numbers = new ArrayList<>(); // ArrayList of Integers
        numbers.add(10);
        numbers.add(20);
        numbers.add(30);

        System.out.println(numbers.get(1)); // Accessing an element (index 1)
        numbers.remove(0); // Removing an element at index 0
        System.out.println(numbers.size()); // Getting the ArrayList's size
        
        ArrayList<String> names = new ArrayList<>(List.of("Alice", "Bob")); // Initializing with values

        for (int number : numbers) { // Enhanced for loop to iterate
            System.out.println(number);
        }
    }
}
```

`ArrayLists` are particularly useful when you don't know the exact number of elements in advance.  Methods like `add()`, `remove()`, `get()`, and `size()` provide convenient operations for managing the list.


### Hashmaps

Hashmaps (specifically `HashMap` in Java) are key-value data structures.  They store data in key-value pairs, allowing you to access values using their associated keys.  Keys must be unique, while values can be duplicated.  `HashMaps` are part of the Java Collections Framework and provide efficient lookups.

```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        HashMap<String, Integer> ages = new HashMap<>(); // HashMap with String keys and Integer values
        ages.put("Alice", 30);
        ages.put("Bob", 25);
        ages.put("Charlie", 35);

        System.out.println(ages.get("Bob")); // Accessing a value using its key
        System.out.println(ages.containsKey("Alice")); // Checking if a key exists
        System.out.println(ages.size()); // Getting the HashMap's size

        for (Map.Entry<String, Integer> entry : ages.entrySet()) { // Iterating through entries
            System.out.println(entry.getKey() + ": " + entry.getValue());
        }

    }
}
```

`HashMaps` are highly efficient for searching and retrieving data because they use a hash function to map keys to their corresponding values.  They are ideal when you need to quickly find a value based on a unique identifier.  Note that the order of elements in a `HashMap` isn't guaranteed.  If you need to maintain insertion order, consider using `LinkedHashMap`.


## Exception Handling

Exception handling is a crucial aspect of robust programming.  It allows you to gracefully handle errors that may occur during program execution, preventing your program from crashing unexpectedly.  Java uses a `try-catch` mechanism to manage exceptions.

### Try-Catch Blocks

The basic structure of exception handling involves a `try` block, which contains the code that might throw an exception, and one or more `catch` blocks, which handle specific types of exceptions.

```java
import java.io.IOException;
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        try {
            System.out.print("Enter a number: ");
            int num = scanner.nextInt();
            int result = 10 / num; // Potential ArithmeticException if num is 0
            System.out.println("Result: " + result);
        } catch (ArithmeticException e) {
            System.err.println("Error: Cannot divide by zero!");
            System.err.println(e.getMessage()); //Optional: Print exception message
        } catch (InputMismatchException e) {
            System.err.println("Error: Invalid input. Please enter a number.");
            scanner.next(); // consume the bad input
        } finally {
            scanner.close(); //Ensures Scanner is closed even if exceptions occurred
        }
    }
}
```

This code attempts to read an integer from the user and divide 10 by it.  The `try` block contains this potentially problematic code.  The `catch (ArithmeticException e)` block handles the case where the user enters 0, and `catch (InputMismatchException e)` handles cases where the input is not a number. The `finally` block guarantees that resources (like the scanner) are released even if exceptions occur.


### Types of Exceptions

Java has a rich hierarchy of exception classes.  Some common types include:

* **`RuntimeException` (and its subclasses):** These are unchecked exceptions that don't require explicit handling (though it's good practice to handle them).  Examples include `NullPointerException`, `ArithmeticException`, `IndexOutOfBoundsException`, `IllegalArgumentException`.
* **Checked exceptions:** These exceptions must be explicitly handled using `try-catch` blocks or declared using the `throws` keyword in the method signature.  Examples include `IOException`, `SQLException`.


### Throwing Exceptions

You can explicitly throw exceptions using the `throw` keyword. This is often done when you detect an error condition that should be handled elsewhere in your code.

```java
public class MyException extends Exception {
    // custom exception class
    public MyException(String message){
        super(message);
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void checkAge(int age) throws MyException {
        if (age < 0) {
            throw new MyException("Age cannot be negative"); // Throw custom exception
        }
        System.out.println("Age is valid.");
    }
    public static void main(String[] args){
        try{
            checkAge(-5);
        } catch (MyException e){
            System.err.println("Exception Caught: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

This example defines a custom exception `MyException` and throws it if the age is negative.  The `throws` keyword in the method signature indicates that the `checkAge` method can throw this exception.  The calling method (main) must handle this using a `try-catch` block.  Note that checked exceptions must either be handled or declared in the method signature.  Unchecked exceptions (like `RuntimeException`) do not require this.
