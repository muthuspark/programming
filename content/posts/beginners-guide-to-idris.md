## Introduction to Idris

### What is Idris?

Idris is a purely functional programming language with dependent types.  This means it combines the benefits of functional programming (like immutability, referential transparency, and higher-order functions) with the power of dependent types, allowing you to express complex program properties and prove them correct within the type system.  Unlike languages like Haskell, which have a separate type system, Idris's type system is deeply integrated, allowing for powerful compile-time guarantees and enhanced code reliability. This makes Idris particularly well-suited for projects requiring high levels of correctness, such as formal verification and compiler development.  It also excels in areas where precise control over data structures and their invariants is critical.


### Why learn Idris?

Learning Idris offers several compelling advantages:

* **Enhanced Code Correctness:** Dependent types allow you to specify and verify properties about your data and functions during compilation.  This drastically reduces the likelihood of runtime errors.
* **Improved Code Readability and Maintainability:**  The expressiveness of the type system allows for more concise and self-documenting code.  The compiler helps catch errors early, reducing debugging time.
* **Deep Understanding of Programming Fundamentals:**  Learning Idris necessitates a deeper understanding of functional programming principles and type theory, which benefits your programming skills in other languages.
* **Formal Methods Exploration:**  Idris provides a practical entry point to the field of formal methods and program verification.
* **Unique Problem Solving Abilities:**  Idris allows you to solve problems in ways impossible or impractical in other languages due to its expressive type system.


### Setting up your Idris development environment

The simplest way to get started with Idris is using the official installer for your operating system. You can find the latest installers and instructions on the official Idris website [https://www.idris-lang.org/](https://www.idris-lang.org/).  The installation process usually involves downloading and running an installer specific to your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).

Alternatively, you can use a package manager such as `apt` (Debian/Ubuntu), `brew` (macOS), or `pacman` (Arch Linux). Consult the Idris website for the most up-to-date package manager instructions.

Once Idris is installed, you'll need a text editor or IDE.  While a simple text editor will suffice for small programs, an IDE with Idris support offers significant benefits like syntax highlighting, code completion, and type checking.  Popular choices include:

* **VS Code with the Idris plugin:** This provides a lightweight but powerful development experience.
* **Emacs/Vim with appropriate plugins:**  These editors, known for their extensibility, offer excellent Idris support through community-maintained plugins.

After installation, verify your Idris installation by opening a terminal or command prompt and typing `idris --version`. This should display the version number of your Idris installation.


### Your first Idris program

Let's write a simple "Hello, world!" program in Idris:

```idris
main : IO ()
main = putStrLn "Hello, world!"
```

Save this code as a file named `hello.idr`.  Then, compile and run it from your terminal using:

```bash
idris hello.idr
./hello
```

This will compile your code and then execute the `main` function, printing "Hello, world!" to the console.  The `main` function's type signature `IO ()` indicates that it performs input/output operations and returns no value (represented by `()`). `putStrLn` is a function that prints a string to the console and adds a newline character. This simple example introduces basic Idris syntax and the compilation/execution process.


## Idris Basics

### Types and Type Inference

Idris is a statically-typed language, meaning that the type of every expression is known at compile time.  Idris uses a powerful type system based on dependent types, but even without delving into the complexities of dependent types, understanding basic type declarations and inference is crucial.

Type annotations in Idris are usually optional. Idris's type inference system is sophisticated enough to deduce the types of many expressions automatically.  However, providing explicit type annotations improves code readability, aids in understanding complex code, and can help catch errors early.

For example:

```idris
x : Int
x = 5

y = 10  -- Idris infers y to be of type Int

add : Int -> Int -> Int
add x y = x + y
```

In this example, `x` is explicitly declared to be of type `Int`.  `y`'s type is inferred as `Int` by Idris. The function `add` is explicitly given the type signature `Int -> Int -> Int`, indicating it takes two integers as input and returns an integer.


### Basic Data Types (Integers, Booleans, Strings)

Idris provides several built-in data types:

* **Integers (`Int`):** Represent whole numbers.  Idris supports various integer types with different precisions (e.g., `Int8`, `Int16`, `Int32`, `Int64`).  If not specified, `Int` is usually a system-dependent integer size.

* **Booleans (`Bool`):** Represent truth values, with the literals `True` and `False`.

* **Strings (`String`):** Represent sequences of characters. String literals are enclosed in double quotes, e.g., `"Hello, world!"`.

Example:

```idris
myInt : Int
myInt = 42

myBool : Bool
myBool = True

myString : String
myString = "Idris is awesome!"
```


### Functions and Function Definitions

Functions in Idris are defined using the `=` symbol.  The type signature (the type of the function's input and output) is optional, but recommended for clarity and to aid type inference.

Example:

```idris
addOne : Int -> Int
addOne x = x + 1

greet : String -> String
greet name = "Hello, " ++ name ++ "!"
```

The `addOne` function takes an integer `x` as input and returns `x + 1`. The `greet` function concatenates strings using the `++` operator.


### Pattern Matching

Pattern matching is a powerful feature in Idris that allows you to define functions that behave differently based on the structure of their input. It's often used with algebraic data types (discussed later), but can also be used with simpler types like integers.

Example:

```idris
factorial : Nat -> Nat
factorial 0 = 1
factorial n = n * factorial (n - 1)
```

This defines the factorial function using pattern matching. If the input `n` is 0, it returns 1; otherwise, it recursively calls itself with `n-1`. `Nat` is a natural number type (non-negative integers).


### Working with Lists

Lists in Idris are represented using the `List` type constructor.  A list of integers would be denoted as `List Int`.  You can create lists using square brackets `[]` or by using the `::` (cons) operator to add an element to the head of a list.

Example:

```idris
myList : List Int
myList = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

anotherList : List Int
anotherList = 1 :: 2 :: 3 :: []

sumList : List Int -> Int
sumList [] = 0
sumList (x :: xs) = x + sumList xs
```

`myList` shows a list literal.  `anotherList` demonstrates using the `::` operator to construct a list.  `sumList` recursively calculates the sum of elements in a list using pattern matching.  The empty list `[]` is handled as the base case.


## Dependent Types

### Understanding Dependent Types

Dependent types are types that depend on values.  This is a powerful concept that allows you to express relationships between data and types within the type system itself.  In contrast to ordinary types, where the type of an expression is independent of the values it manipulates, a dependent type's definition involves values.  This allows for stronger compile-time guarantees and more expressive type specifications.  For example, a vector of a specific length can be represented with a type that depends on the length value. This prevents you from accidentally accessing elements beyond the vector's bounds at compile time.


### Vectors and Their Dependent Types

A prime example of dependent types in Idris is the `Vect` type.  `Vect n a` represents a vector of length `n` containing elements of type `a`.  The length `n` is a *value* that affects the *type*.  You can't create a `Vect 5 Int` and then try to access its 6th element; the type system will prevent this at compile time.

```idris
myVector : Vect 3 Int
myVector = [1, 2, 3]

-- This will cause a type error:
-- invalidVector : Vect 3 Int
-- invalidVector = [1,2,3,4]
```

The compiler ensures that the length specified in the `Vect` type matches the actual length of the vector at compile time.


### Type-Level Computation

Dependent types enable type-level computation.  This means you can perform calculations and logic *within* the type system itself, before runtime. This is often used to enforce constraints and perform sophisticated static analysis.  For example, you can define a type that represents the result of a computation, and the type system will guarantee that the computation has been performed correctly at compile time.


Consider a function that calculates the factorial:

```idris
factorial : Nat -> Nat
factorial zero = 1
factorial (suc n) = suc n * factorial n

-- We could define a type representing the result of a factorial calculation:
data FactorialResult (n : Nat) : Type where
  FactorialResult : (result : Nat) -> FactorialResult n
```

While a full exploration of this example would be quite advanced,  the key idea is that `FactorialResult` is a type that depends on the input `n`. It would require further work to properly connect it with a verified `factorial` function.


### Using Dependent Types for Data Validation

Dependent types are exceptionally useful for data validation. You can use them to ensure that data structures adhere to specific invariants at compile time. This eliminates the need for runtime checks, improving performance and reliability.

For example, you could define a type for a date that includes validation constraints (e.g., ensuring the month is between 1 and 12, and the day is valid for the given month and year). The type system would then prevent the creation of invalid dates.  This proactive error prevention is one of the main strengths of dependent types.  Note that building such a robust date type would involve more advanced Idris concepts like records, dependent pairs, and potentially even custom type classes.


## Advanced Concepts

### Type Classes

Type classes in Idris provide a way to define a set of operations that can be applied to different types.  They are similar to interfaces or traits in other languages but are integrated more deeply into the type system.  A type class defines a signature (a set of functions with specified types), and types can be declared as *instances* of a type class by providing implementations for those functions.

Example:

```idris
class Show a where
  show : a -> String

instance showInt : Show Int where
  show x = showIntDec x

instance showBool : Show Bool where
  show True  = "True"
  show False = "False"

main : IO ()
main = do
  putStrLn (show 5)       -- Output: 5
  putStrLn (show True)    -- Output: True
```

This defines a `Show` type class with a `show` function that converts a value to a string.  We then define instances for `Int` and `Bool`, providing implementations of `show` for each type.


### Data Types (Records, Variants)

Idris supports several ways to define custom data types:

* **Records:**  Records group together named fields of potentially different types.  They are useful for representing structured data.

```idris
data Person = Person { name : String, age : Int }

myPerson : Person
myPerson = Person { name = "Alice", age = 30 }
```

* **Variants (Algebraic Data Types):** Variants represent values that can be one of several possible types. They are fundamental to expressing complex data structures.

```idris
data Shape = Circle Float | Rectangle Float Float
```

This defines a `Shape` type that can be either a `Circle` (with a radius) or a `Rectangle` (with width and height).


### Modules and Namespaces

Modules in Idris organize code into separate files, providing namespaces and preventing naming collisions.  A module declaration starts with `module`.  You can export specific items from a module using the `export` keyword.


Example (file: `MyModule.idr`):

```idris
module MyModule where

export
myFunction : Int -> Int
myFunction x = x * 2
```

To use `myFunction` in another file:

```idris
import MyModule

main : IO ()
main = putStrLn (show (MyModule.myFunction 5)) -- Output: 10
```


### Error Handling with Exceptions

Idris uses exceptions for error handling.  The `IO` monad provides facilities for exception handling.  The `try` and `catch` keywords are used to handle exceptions.

Example:

```idris
import System.IO

main : IO ()
main = do
  result <- try (unsafePerformIO (readFile "nonexistent_file.txt"))
  case result of
    Left e  => putStrLn ("Error: " ++ show e)
    Right s => putStrLn s
```

This attempts to read a file. If the file doesn't exist, it catches the exception and prints an error message.


### Writing Your Own Types

Creating custom types is a core part of Idris programming.  You've already seen examples with records and variants.  However, the power of Idris truly shines when you combine these with dependent types to create types that enforce complex invariants.  The design of custom types is driven by the specific problem domain and the invariants that need to be enforced.  This often requires a solid understanding of type theory and functional programming paradigms.


## Practical Examples

### Building a Simple Calculator

Let's build a simple calculator that can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. We'll use pattern matching to handle different operations:

```idris
data Operation = Add | Subtract | Multiply | Divide

calculate : Operation -> Int -> Int -> Maybe Int
calculate Add x y = Just (x + y)
calculate Subtract x y = Just (x - y)
calculate Multiply x y = Just (x * y)
calculate Divide x y = if y == 0 then Nothing else Just (x / y)

main : IO ()
main = do
  putStrLn "Enter first number:"
  input1 <- readLn
  putStrLn "Enter operation (+, -, *, /):"
  opStr <- getLine
  putStrLn "Enter second number:"
  input2 <- readLn

  let op = case opStr of
              "+" -> Add
              "-" -> Subtract
              "*" -> Multiply
              "/" -> Divide
              _   -> error "Invalid operation"

  case calculate op input1 input2 of
    Just result -> putStrLn ("Result: " ++ show result)
    Nothing     -> putStrLn "Division by zero!"
```

This code defines an `Operation` data type, a `calculate` function using pattern matching, and a `main` function to handle user input and output.  Error handling for division by zero is included using the `Maybe` type.  Note that robust error handling and input validation would require more sophisticated techniques in a production-ready calculator.


### Implementing a Small Game

Let's create a simple number guessing game:

```idris
import System.Random

main : IO ()
main = do
  secret <- uniform 1 100
  putStrLn "I've chosen a number between 1 and 100. Guess it!"
  guessingLoop secret

guessingLoop : Int -> IO ()
guessingLoop secret = do
  putStrLn "Enter your guess:"
  guess <- readLn
  if guess == secret then
    putStrLn "Congratulations! You guessed it!"
  else if guess < secret then
    putStrLn "Too low! Try again." >> guessingLoop secret
  else
    putStrLn "Too high! Try again." >> guessingLoop secret
```

This uses `System.Random` to generate a random number. The `guessingLoop` function recursively prompts the user for guesses until the correct number is entered.


### Working with External Libraries

Idris can interact with external libraries through the use of Foreign Function Interfaces (FFIs).  The specifics depend on the library and its availability as an Idris binding.  If a direct Idris binding isn't available, you might need to create one, which can be a complex undertaking.

A simplified example (assuming a hypothetical library for image processing):

```idris
-- Assuming an Idris binding exists for the hypothetical image library
import ImageProcessing

main : IO ()
main = do
  -- Load an image
  image <- loadImage "my_image.png"

  -- Process the image (hypothetical function)
  processedImage <- applyFilter image blurFilter

  -- Save the processed image
  saveImage processedImage "blurred_image.png"
```

This example demonstrates the basic interaction with a hypothetical image processing library. The actual implementation of such a binding would involve a significant amount of work to handle data marshaling between Idris and the foreign library.  You'd typically need to consult the specific library's documentation and any available Idris bindings.  The Idris community provides packages and tutorials for interfacing with various external libraries; check the official package repository for details.
