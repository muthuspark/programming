## Introduction to PHP

### What is PHP?

PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) is a widely-used, open-source, server-side scripting language embedded in HTML.  This means PHP code is executed on the web server, not the user's computer.  The server processes the PHP code and sends the resulting HTML to the user's browser, dynamically generating web pages.  Unlike client-side languages like JavaScript, which run in the user's browser, PHP interacts directly with databases and server resources to create interactive and data-driven websites.

### Why Use PHP?

PHP offers several compelling reasons for its continued popularity:

* **Server-Side Scripting:**  PHP excels at handling server-side logic, enabling you to create dynamic web pages that interact with databases, process forms, and manage user sessions.
* **Large Community & Resources:**  A vast and active community supports PHP, offering ample resources, tutorials, and frameworks.  Finding solutions to problems and getting help is relatively easy.
* **Ease of Use:**  PHP has a relatively straightforward syntax, making it easier to learn than some other server-side languages.  Many readily available frameworks simplify development even further.
* **Open Source & Free:** PHP is free to use and distribute, eliminating licensing costs.
* **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** PHP runs on various operating systems, including Windows, Linux, and macOS, offering flexibility in deployment.
* **Extensive Libraries & Frameworks:**  Numerous libraries and frameworks (like Laravel, Symfony, CodeIgniter) extend PHP's capabilities, providing pre-built components and structures for efficient development.


### Setting up your environment

To start programming in PHP, you'll need a few things:

1. **A Web Server:**  You need a web server like Apache or Nginx to run PHP code.  XAMPP or WAMP are popular all-in-one packages that include a web server, PHP interpreter, and MySQL database – perfect for beginners.  These packages install easily on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

2. **PHP Interpreter:** This is the software that translates your PHP code into instructions the web server can understand.  It's usually bundled with web server packages like XAMPP and WAMP.

3. **A Text Editor or IDE:** You'll need a text editor (like Notepad++, Sublime Text, VS Code) or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE, like PhpStorm) to write your PHP code.  IDEs offer features like code highlighting, debugging, and autocompletion, greatly enhancing the development experience.

4. **Database (Optional but Recommended):** While not strictly necessary for your first programs, a database (like MySQL, included in XAMPP/WAMP) is essential for most real-world web applications.  It's used to store and retrieve data.

After installing your chosen web server package (e.g., XAMPP), ensure the PHP interpreter is correctly configured.  You might need to adjust settings in the web server's configuration files depending on your setup, but often the default configuration works fine for beginners.


### Hello World! Your first PHP program.

The classic first program in any language is "Hello, World!":

```php
<?php
  echo "Hello, World!";
?>
```

Save this code in a file named (for example) `hello.php` within your web server's document root directory (usually `htdocs` in XAMPP). Then, access the file through your web browser by entering its URL (something like `http://localhost/hello.php` if you're using XAMPP).  You should see "Hello, World!" displayed in your browser.  This simple program demonstrates the fundamental PHP syntax – the code is enclosed within `<?php` and `?>` tags, and the `echo` statement displays output.


## Basic Syntax and Data Types

### Variables and Data Types

PHP is a loosely typed language, meaning you don't explicitly declare the data type of a variable.  The type is determined by the value assigned to it.  Variable names start with a dollar sign ($) followed by a letter or underscore, and can contain letters, numbers, and underscores.

**Common Data Types:**

* **Integer (int):** Whole numbers (e.g., 10, -5, 0).
* **Float (float/double):**  Floating-point numbers (e.g., 3.14, -2.5).
* **String (string):**  Sequences of characters (e.g., "Hello", 'PHP').  Strings can be enclosed in single (' ') or double (" ") quotes.
* **Boolean (bool):**  Represents true or false values.
* **Array (array):**  Ordered collections of values.
* **Null (null):** Represents the absence of a value.


**Example:**

```php
<?php
  $name = "John Doe"; // String
  $age = 30;       // Integer
  $height = 5.10;   // Float
  $isAdult = true;  // Boolean
  $colors = array("red", "green", "blue"); // Array
  $emptyVar = null; // Null
?>
```

### Operators

PHP supports a wide range of operators:

* **Arithmetic Operators:**  `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%` (modulo), `**` (exponentiation).
* **Assignment Operators:** `=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=`, `.=`.
* **Comparison Operators:** `==` (equal to), `!=` (not equal to), `===` (identical to), `!==` (not identical to), `>` (greater than), `<` (less than), `>=` (greater than or equal to), `<=` (less than or equal to).
* **Logical Operators:** `&&` (AND), `||` (OR), `!` (NOT).
* **Increment/Decrement Operators:** `++`, `--`.


**Example:**

```php
<?php
  $x = 10;
  $y = 5;
  $sum = $x + $y;       // Addition
  $diff = $x - $y;      // Subtraction
  $product = $x * $y;    // Multiplication
  $quotient = $x / $y;   // Division
  $remainder = $x % $y;  // Modulo
  $isGreater = ($x > $y); // Comparison
?>
```


### Comments

Comments are used to explain code and make it more readable.  PHP supports single-line and multi-line comments:

* **Single-line comment:** `// This is a single-line comment`
* **Multi-line comment:** `/* This is a
multi-line comment */`


**Example:**

```php
<?php
  // This is a single-line comment
  $name = "Alice";  // Assigning a value to the $name variable

  /* This is a
     multi-line comment */
  $age = 25;
?>
```


### Control Structures (if, else, switch)

Control structures determine the flow of execution in your code.

* **`if` statement:** Executes a block of code only if a condition is true.

```php
<?php
  $age = 20;
  if ($age >= 18) {
    echo "You are an adult.";
  }
?>
```

* **`if-else` statement:** Executes one block of code if a condition is true, and another block if it's false.

```php
<?php
  $age = 15;
  if ($age >= 18) {
    echo "You are an adult.";
  } else {
    echo "You are a minor.";
  }
?>
```

* **`if-elseif-else` statement:** Allows checking multiple conditions sequentially.

```php
<?php
  $grade = 85;
  if ($grade >= 90) {
    echo "A";
  } elseif ($grade >= 80) {
    echo "B";
  } elseif ($grade >= 70) {
    echo "C";
  } else {
    echo "F";
  }
?>
```

* **`switch` statement:** Provides a more concise way to handle multiple conditions based on the value of a single expression.

```php
<?php
  $day = "Monday";
  switch ($day) {
    case "Monday":
      echo "It's the start of the week.";
      break;
    case "Friday":
      echo "Almost weekend!";
      break;
    default:
      echo "It's another day.";
  }
?>
```

The `break` statement is crucial in `switch` statements; it prevents the code from "falling through" to the next case.  Without `break`,  the code will execute all subsequent cases until a `break` or the end of the `switch` is reached.


## Working with Data

### Arrays

Arrays in PHP are ordered maps.  They can hold multiple values of different data types.  PHP offers both indexed and associative arrays.

* **Indexed Arrays:** Elements are accessed by their numerical index (starting from 0).

```php
<?php
  $numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]; //Using short array syntax (PHP 5.4+)
  echo $numbers[0]; // Output: 10
  echo $numbers[2]; // Output: 30

  $fruits = array("apple", "banana", "orange"); //Older array syntax
  echo $fruits[1]; // Output: banana
?>
```

* **Associative Arrays:** Elements are accessed by their key (which can be a string).

```php
<?php
  $person = [
    "name" => "Alice",
    "age" => 30,
    "city" => "New York"
  ];
  echo $person["name"]; // Output: Alice
  echo $person["age"];  // Output: 30
?>
```

Arrays can be multidimensional (arrays within arrays):

```php
<?php
  $matrix = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6],
    [7, 8, 9]
  ];
  echo $matrix[1][2]; // Output: 6
?>
```

Many built-in functions are available for manipulating arrays (e.g., `count()`, `array_push()`, `sort()`, `in_array()`).


### Strings

Strings in PHP are sequences of characters.  They can be defined using single quotes (' ') or double quotes (" ").  Double-quoted strings allow for variable interpolation (embedding variables directly within the string).

```php
<?php
  $name = "Bob";
  $greeting = 'Hello, ' . $name . '!'; // Concatenation using the . operator
  $greeting2 = "Hello, $name!";       // Variable interpolation
  echo $greeting;  // Output: Hello, Bob!
  echo $greeting2; // Output: Hello, Bob!
?>
```

Many string manipulation functions are available (e.g., `strlen()`, `strpos()`, `substr()`, `str_replace()`).


### Numbers

PHP supports integers and floating-point numbers.  Be mindful of potential precision issues with floating-point numbers due to how they're represented internally.

```php
<?php
  $integer = 123;
  $float = 3.14159;
  $sum = $integer + $float;
  echo $sum; // Output: 126.14159
?>
```

Mathematical functions are available (e.g., `abs()`, `round()`, `sqrt()`, `pow()`).


### Type Juggling and Type Casting

PHP's loose typing allows for *type juggling*, where PHP automatically converts data types during operations.  However, it's often better to use *type casting* for explicit type conversion to avoid unexpected behavior.

**Type Juggling:**

```php
<?php
  $x = "5";
  $y = 10;
  $sum = $x + $y; // $x is automatically converted to an integer (type juggling)
  echo $sum;     // Output: 15
?>
```

**Type Casting:**

```php
<?php
  $x = "5";
  $y = 10;
  $sum = (int)$x + $y; // Explicit type casting of $x to an integer
  echo $sum;           // Output: 15

  $floatString = "3.14";
  $floatNumber = (float)$floatString; //Casting to float
  echo $floatNumber; //Output: 3.14

  $boolInt = (int) true; //Casting boolean to integer - true becomes 1
  echo $boolInt; //Output: 1
?>
```

Type casting ensures clarity and avoids potential errors arising from implicit type conversions.  Common casting functions include `(int)`, `(float)`, `(string)`, `(bool)`, `(array)`.  Always cast to the intended type.


## Functions

Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks.  They improve code organization, readability, and maintainability.

### Defining Functions

Functions are defined using the `function` keyword, followed by the function name, parentheses `()`, and curly braces `{}` enclosing the function's code.

```php
<?php
  function greet($name) {
    echo "Hello, $name!";
  }

  greet("Alice"); // Calling the function
?>
```

The function name should follow the same rules as variable names (start with a letter or underscore, contain letters, numbers, and underscores).  It's good practice to use descriptive names that clearly indicate the function's purpose.

### Function Arguments

Arguments (or parameters) are values passed to a function.  They are defined within the parentheses in the function definition.

```php
<?php
  function add($x, $y) {
    return $x + $y;
  }

  $sum = add(5, 3); // Passing arguments to the function
  echo $sum;       // Output: 8
?>
```

You can have multiple arguments, separated by commas.  Arguments can be of any data type.

### Return Values

Functions can return a value using the `return` statement.  If a function doesn't have an explicit `return` statement, it implicitly returns `null`.

```php
<?php
  function getArea($width, $height) {
    return $width * $height;
  }

  $area = getArea(10, 5);
  echo $area; // Output: 50
?>
```

The `return` statement immediately exits the function.  Any code after a `return` statement within the function will not be executed.

### Function Scope

Scope refers to the accessibility of variables within a program.  Variables declared inside a function have *local scope*, meaning they are only accessible within that function.  Variables declared outside functions have *global scope*, accessible from anywhere in the script.

```php
<?php
  $globalVar = "I'm global"; // Global variable

  function myFunction() {
    $localVar = "I'm local"; // Local variable
    echo $globalVar; // Accessing global variable from inside the function
    echo $localVar;  // Accessing local variable
  }

  myFunction();
  // echo $localVar; // This would cause an error because $localVar is out of scope here
  echo $globalVar;  // Accessing global variable outside the function
?>
```

To access a global variable from within a function, you can use the `global` keyword:

```php
<?php
  $globalVar = "I'm global";

  function accessGlobal() {
    global $globalVar;
    echo $globalVar;
  }

  accessGlobal(); // Outputs: I'm global
?>
```

Using global variables within functions can make code harder to understand and maintain; it's generally better to pass data to functions as arguments and return values rather than relying heavily on global variables.  This promotes better encapsulation and reduces the risk of unintended side effects.


## Working with Files

PHP provides a robust set of functions for working with files on the server's file system.  This allows you to read data from files, write data to files, and perform various other file operations.  Remember that file operations require appropriate permissions on the server.

### Reading Files

The most common way to read a file is using `file_get_contents()`, which reads the entire file into a single string:


```php
<?php
  $filename = "my_file.txt";
  $fileContent = file_get_contents($filename);
  if ($fileContent === false) {
    echo "Error reading file.";
  } else {
    echo $fileContent;
  }
?>
```

For larger files, reading line by line using `fopen()`, `fgets()`, and `fclose()` is more efficient:

```php
<?php
  $filename = "my_large_file.txt";
  $fileHandle = fopen($filename, "r"); // "r" for reading
  if ($fileHandle === false) {
    echo "Error opening file.";
  } else {
    while (($line = fgets($fileHandle)) !== false) {
      echo $line; // Process each line individually
    }
    fclose($fileHandle); // Always close the file handle
  }
?>
```

`fopen()` opens the file, `fgets()` reads one line at a time, and `fclose()` closes the file (crucial to release resources).


### Writing Files

To write to a file, use `file_put_contents()`:

```php
<?php
  $filename = "output.txt";
  $data = "This is some text to write to the file.";
  $bytesWritten = file_put_contents($filename, $data);
  if ($bytesWritten === false) {
    echo "Error writing to file.";
  } else {
    echo "Successfully wrote $bytesWritten bytes to the file.";
  }
?>
```

This overwrites the file if it exists.  To append data to an existing file, use the `FILE_APPEND` flag:


```php
<?php
  $filename = "output.txt";
  $newData = "\nThis is additional text."; //Add a newline character at the beginning
  $bytesAppended = file_put_contents($filename, $newData, FILE_APPEND);
  if ($bytesAppended === false) {
    echo "Error appending to file.";
  } else {
    echo "Successfully appended $bytesAppended bytes to the file.";
  }
?>

```


For more controlled writing (e.g., writing line by line), use `fopen()` with `"w"` (write) or `"a"` (append) mode, `fwrite()`, and `fclose()`:

```php
<?php
  $filename = "another_output.txt";
  $fileHandle = fopen($filename, "w"); // "w" for writing (overwrites)
  if ($fileHandle === false) {
    echo "Error opening file.";
  } else {
    $lines = ["Line 1\n", "Line 2\n", "Line 3\n"];
    foreach ($lines as $line) {
      fwrite($fileHandle, $line);
    }
    fclose($fileHandle);
  }
?>
```


### File Handling Functions

PHP provides many functions for file manipulation:

* **`fopen($filename, $mode)`:** Opens a file.  `$mode` specifies the access mode (e.g., "r" for reading, "w" for writing, "a" for appending, "x" for exclusive creation).
* **`fclose($handle)`:** Closes a file handle.  Always close files when finished.
* **`fgets($handle)`:** Reads a single line from a file.
* **`fread($handle, $length)`:** Reads a specified number of bytes from a file.
* **`fwrite($handle, $data)`:** Writes data to a file.
* **`file_exists($filename)`:** Checks if a file exists.
* **`filesize($filename)`:** Gets the size of a file in bytes.
* **`unlink($filename)`:** Deletes a file.
* **`rename($oldName, $newName)`:** Renames a file.
* **`is_readable($filename)`:** Checks if a file is readable.
* **`is_writable($filename)`:** Checks if a file is writable.
* **`file_get_contents($filename)`:** Reads the entire file into a string.
* **`file_put_contents($filename, $data)`:** Writes a string to a file.


Remember to always handle potential errors (e.g., file not found, permission issues) using appropriate error checking (e.g., checking the return values of functions).  Always close file handles using `fclose()` to prevent resource leaks.


## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Basics

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a powerful programming paradigm that organizes code around "objects" rather than actions and data.  PHP supports OOP, allowing you to create reusable and well-structured code.

### Classes and Objects

A *class* is a blueprint for creating objects.  It defines the properties (data) and methods (functions) that objects of that class will have.  An *object* is an instance of a class.

```php
<?php
  class Dog {
    // Properties and methods will go here
  }

  $myDog = new Dog(); // Creating an object (instance) of the Dog class
?>
```

This code defines a `Dog` class and creates an object (`$myDog`) of that class.  The object is an instance of the blueprint defined by the class.

### Properties and Methods

*Properties* are variables that hold data within an object.  *Methods* are functions that operate on the object's data.

```php
<?php
  class Dog {
    public $name;       // Property: the dog's name
    public $breed;      // Property: the dog's breed
    public $age;        //Property: the dog's age

    public function bark() { // Method: makes the dog bark
      echo "Woof!";
    }

    public function introduce() { //Method: introduces the dog
      echo "My name is " . $this->name . ", I am a " . $this->breed . ", and I am " . $this->age . " years old.\n";
    }
  }

  $myDog = new Dog();
  $myDog->name = "Buddy";
  $myDog->breed = "Golden Retriever";
  $myDog->age = 3;
  $myDog->bark(); // Output: Woof!
  $myDog->introduce(); //Output: My name is Buddy, I am a Golden Retriever, and I am 3 years old.

?>
```

`$this` refers to the current object.  Access properties and methods using the `->` operator (object operator).  The `public` access modifier makes the properties and methods accessible from anywhere. Other access modifiers include `private` (accessible only within the class) and `protected` (accessible within the class and its subclasses).

### Constructors and Destructors

A *constructor* is a special method that is automatically called when an object is created.  It's used to initialize the object's properties.  A *destructor* is a special method that is automatically called when an object is destroyed (when it's no longer needed).

```php
<?php
  class Dog {
    public $name;
    public $breed;

    public function __construct($name, $breed) { // Constructor
      $this->name = $name;
      $this->breed = $breed;
    }

    public function __destruct() { // Destructor
      echo "Dog " . $this->name . " is being destroyed.\n";
    }
  }

  $myDog = new Dog("Lucy", "Labrador");
  // ... use the object ...
  //When the script finishes, the destructor is called automatically.

?>
```

The constructor takes the dog's name and breed as arguments and initializes the properties.  The destructor prints a message when the object is destroyed.  Constructor and destructor names are predefined (`__construct` and `__destruct`).


### Inheritance

*Inheritance* allows you to create new classes (child classes or subclasses) based on existing classes (parent classes or superclasses).  The child class inherits the properties and methods of the parent class and can add its own properties and methods or override existing ones.

```php
<?php
  class Animal { // Parent class
    public $name;
    public function makeSound() {
      echo "Generic animal sound\n";
    }
  }

  class Cat extends Animal { // Child class inheriting from Animal
    public function makeSound() { //Overriding the method
      echo "Meow!\n";
    }
  }

  $myCat = new Cat();
  $myCat->name = "Whiskers";
  $myCat->makeSound(); // Output: Meow!
?>
```

The `Cat` class inherits `name` and `makeSound()` from `Animal` but overrides `makeSound()` to provide cat-specific behavior.  `extends` keyword indicates inheritance.  Inheritance promotes code reusability and reduces redundancy.


## Connecting to Databases

This section covers connecting to and interacting with MySQL databases, a popular choice for web applications.  Remember that database interaction requires appropriate server-side configuration and user credentials.

### Introduction to MySQL

MySQL is a widely used open-source Relational Database Management System (RDBMS).  It stores data in tables with rows (records) and columns (fields).  Data is organized and accessed efficiently using Structured Query Language (SQL).  MySQL is often used alongside PHP for dynamic web applications, where PHP handles the application logic and MySQL manages the persistent data.

### Connecting to a MySQL database

To connect to a MySQL database from PHP, you use the `mysqli` extension (or the older `mysql` extension, though `mysqli` is recommended for improved security and features).

```php
<?php
  // Database credentials
  $servername = "localhost";
  $username = "your_username";
  $password = "your_password";
  $dbname = "your_database_name";

  // Create connection
  $conn = new mysqli($servername, $username, $password, $dbname);

  // Check connection
  if ($conn->connect_error) {
    die("Connection failed: " . $conn->connect_error);
  }
  echo "Connected successfully";

  //Remember to close the connection when finished:
  $conn->close();
?>
```

Replace `"your_username"`, `"your_password"`, and `"your_database_name"` with your actual credentials.  Error handling is crucial to catch connection problems.  The `mysqli` object provides methods for executing SQL queries.


### Performing basic CRUD operations

CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete – the four fundamental operations in database management.

**Create (INSERT):**

```php
<?php
  // ... (connection code from above) ...

  $sql = "INSERT INTO users (name, email) VALUES ('John Doe', 'john.doe@example.com')";
  if ($conn->query($sql) === TRUE) {
    echo "New record created successfully";
  } else {
    echo "Error: " . $sql . "<br>" . $conn->error;
  }

  // ... $conn->close(); ...
?>
```

This inserts a new row into the `users` table.

**Read (SELECT):**

```php
<?php
  // ... (connection code) ...

  $sql = "SELECT name, email FROM users";
  $result = $conn->query($sql);

  if ($result->num_rows > 0) {
    while($row = $result->fetch_assoc()) {
      echo "Name: " . $row["name"]. " - Email: " . $row["email"]. "<br>";
    }
  } else {
    echo "0 results";
  }

  // ... $conn->close(); ...
?>
```

This selects data from the `users` table.

**Update (UPDATE):**

```php
<?php
  // ... (connection code) ...

  $sql = "UPDATE users SET email='john.updated@example.com' WHERE name='John Doe'";
  if ($conn->query($sql) === TRUE) {
    echo "Record updated successfully";
  } else {
    echo "Error updating record: " . $conn->error;
  }

  // ... $conn->close(); ...
?>
```

This updates an existing row in the `users` table.

**Delete (DELETE):**

```php
<?php
  // ... (connection code) ...

  $sql = "DELETE FROM users WHERE name='John Doe'";
  if ($conn->query($sql) === TRUE) {
    echo "Record deleted successfully";
  } else {
    echo "Error deleting record: " . $conn->error;
  }

  // ... $conn->close(); ...
?>
```

This deletes a row from the `users` table.  Always use `WHERE` clauses to avoid accidentally deleting all data.


### Security considerations

Database security is paramount.  **Never** hardcode database credentials directly in your code; use environment variables or configuration files to store sensitive information securely.

* **Prepared Statements:**  Use prepared statements to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.  Prepared statements separate SQL code from user-supplied data, preventing malicious code from being executed.

* **Input Sanitization:**  Always sanitize user inputs before using them in SQL queries to prevent injection attacks.

* **Least Privilege:**  Grant database users only the necessary permissions.  Avoid granting excessive privileges to prevent unauthorized access.

* **Stored Procedures:**  Use stored procedures to encapsulate database logic and enhance security.

* **Regular Security Audits:**  Conduct regular security audits to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.

* **Output Encoding:**  Encode output to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.

Ignoring these security best practices can lead to significant security risks and data breaches.  Always prioritize secure coding practices when working with databases.


## Further Learning

This section points you towards resources and concepts to expand your PHP knowledge beyond the basics.

### Advanced PHP concepts
